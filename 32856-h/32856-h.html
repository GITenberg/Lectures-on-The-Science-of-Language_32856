My Lectures on the Science of Language are here
printed as I had prepared them in manuscript for the
Royal Institution. When I came to deliver them, a
considerable portion of what I had written had to be
omitted; and, in now placing them before the public in
a more complete form, I have gladly complied with a
wish expressed by many of my hearers. As they are,
they only form a short abstract of several Courses
delivered from time to time in Oxford, and they do not
pretend to be more than an introduction to a science
far too comprehensive to be treated successfully in so
small a compass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My object, however, will have been attained, if I
should succeed in attracting the attention, not only
of the scholar, but of the philosopher, the historian,
and the theologian, to a science which concerns them
all, and which, though it professes to treat of words
only, teaches us that there is more in words than is
dreamt of in our philosophy. I quote from Bacon:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Men believe that their reason is lord over their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words, but it happens, too, that words exercise a
reciprocal and reactionary power over our intellect.
Words, as a Tartar's bow, shoot back upon the understanding
of the wisest, and mightily entangle and pervert
the judgment.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I was asked some time ago to deliver a
course of lectures on Comparative Philology in this
Institution, I at once expressed my readiness to do so.
I had lived long enough in England to know that the
peculiar difficulties arising from my imperfect knowledge
of the language would be more than balanced by
the forbearance of an English audience, and I had
such perfect faith in my subject that I thought it might
be trusted even in the hands of a less skilful expositor.
I felt convinced that the researches into the history of
languages and into the nature of human speech which
have been carried on for the last fifty years in England,
France, and Germany, deserved a larger share
of public sympathy than they had hitherto received;
and it seemed to me, as far as I could judge, that
the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific
inquiry were not inferior, whether in novelty or
importance, to the most brilliant discoveries of our
age.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not till I began to write my lectures that I
became aware of the difficulties of the task I had
undertaken. The dimensions of the science of language
are so vast that it is impossible in a course of
nine lectures to give more than a very general survey
of it; and as one of the greatest charms of this science
consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which
each language, each dialect, each word, each grammatical
form is tested, I felt that it was almost impossible
to do full justice to my subject, or to place the achievements
of those who founded and fostered the science
of language in their true light. Another difficulty
arises from the dryness of many of the problems which
I shall have to discuss. Declensions and conjugations
cannot be made amusing, nor can I avail myself of
the advantages possessed by most lecturers, who enliven
their discussions by experiments and diagrams.
If, with all these difficulties and drawbacks, I do not
shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on
mere words, on nouns and verbs and particles,—if I
venture to address an audience accustomed to listen, in
this place, to the wonderful tales of the natural historian,
the chemist, and geologist, and wont to see the
novel results of inductive reasoning invested by native
eloquence, with all the charms of poetry and romance,—it
is because, though mistrusting myself, I cannot
mistrust my subject. The study of words may be
tedious to the school-boy, as breaking of stones is to
the wayside laborer; but to the thoughtful eye of the
geologist these stones are full of interest;—he sees
miracles on the high-road, and reads chronicles in every
ditch. Language, too, has marvels of her own, which
she unveils to the inquiring glance of the patient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
student. There are chronicles below her surface;
there are sermons in every word. Language has
been called sacred ground, because it is the deposit
of thought. We cannot tell as yet what language is.
It may be a production of nature, a work of human
art, or a divine gift. But to whatever sphere it belongs,
it would seem to stand unsurpassed—nay,
unequalled in it—by anything else. If it be a production
of nature, it is her last and crowning production
which she reserved for man alone. If it be a
work of human art, it would seem to lift the human
artist almost to the level of a divine creator. If it be
the gift of God, it is God's greatest gift; for through
it God spake to man and man speaks to God in worship,
prayer, and meditation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the way which is before us may be long
and tedious, the point to which it tends would seem to
be full of interest; and I believe I may promise that
the view opened before our eyes from the summit of
our science, will fully repay the patient travellers, and
perhaps secure a free pardon to their venturous guide.

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Science of Language is a science of very modern
date. We cannot trace its lineage much beyond
the beginning of our century, and it is scarcely received
as yet on a footing of equality by the elder
branches of learning. Its very name is still unsettled,
and the various titles that have been given to it in
England, France, and Germany are so vague and varying
that they have led to the most confused ideas
among the public at large as to the real objects of this
new science. We hear it spoken of as Comparative
Philology, Scientific Etymology, Phonology, and Glossology.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In France it has received the convenient, but
somewhat barbarous, name of <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Linguistique</span></span>. If we
must have a Greek title for our science, we might
derive it either from <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">mythos</span></span>,
word, or from <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">logos</span></span>,
speech. But the title of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mythology</span></em> is already occupied,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logology</span></span> would jar too much on classical
ears. We need not waste our time in criticising these
names, as none of them has as yet received that universal
sanction which belongs to the titles of other
modern sciences, such as Geology or Comparative
Anatomy; nor will there be much difficulty in christening
our young science after we have once ascertained
its birth, its parentage, and its character. I
myself prefer the simple designation of the Science
of Language, though in these days of high-sounding
titles, this plain name will hardly meet with general
acceptance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the name we now turn to the meaning of our
science. But before we enter upon a definition of its
subject-matter, and determine the method which ought
to be followed in our researches, it will be useful to cast
a glance at the history of the other sciences, among
which the science of language now, for the first time,
claims her place; and examine their origin, their
gradual progress, and definite settlement. The history
of a science is, as it were, its biography, and as
we buy experience cheapest in studying the lives of
others, we may, perhaps, guard our young science
from some of the follies and extravagances inherent
in youth by learning a lesson for which other
branches of human knowledge have had to pay more
dearly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a certain uniformity in the history of most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sciences. If we read such works as Whewell's History
of the Inductive Sciences or Humboldt's Cosmos,
we find that the origin, the progress, the causes
of failure and success have been the same for almost
every branch of human knowledge. There are three
marked periods or stages in the history of every one
of them, which we may call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Empirical</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Classificatory</span></em>,
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theoretical</span></em>. However humiliating
it may sound, every one of our sciences, however
grand their present titles, can be traced back to the
most humble and homely occupations of half-savage
tribes. It was not the true, the good, and the beautiful
which spurred the early philosophers to deep
researches and bold discoveries. The foundation-stone
of the most glorious structures of human ingenuity
in ages to come was supplied by the pressing
wants of a patriarchal and semi-barbarous society.
The names of some of the most ancient departments
of human knowledge tell their own tale. Geometry,
which at present declares itself free from all sensuous
impressions, and treats of its points and lines and
planes as purely ideal conceptions, not to be confounded
with those coarse and imperfect representations
as they appear on paper to the human eye;
geometry, as its very name declares, began with
measuring a garden or a field. It is derived from
the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gē</span></em>,
land, ground, earth, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metron</span></em>, measure.
Botany, the science of plants, was originally
the science of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">botanē</span></em>, which in Greek does not
mean a plant in general, but fodder, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">boskein</span></em>, to feed.
The science of plants would have been called Phytology,
from the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phyton</span></em>,
a plant.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> The founders
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Astronomy were not the poet or the philosopher,
but the sailor and the farmer. The early poet may
have admired <span class="tei tei-q">“the mazy dance of planets,”</span> and the
philosopher may have speculated on the heavenly harmonies;
but it was to the sailor alone that a knowledge
of the glittering guides of heaven became a
question of life and death. It was he who calculated
their risings and settings with the accuracy of a merchant
and the shrewdness of an adventurer; and the
names that were given to single stars or constellations
clearly show that they were invented by the ploughers
of the sea and of the land. The moon, for instance,
the golden hand on the dark dial of heaven, was
called by them the Measurer,—the measurer of time;
for time was measured by nights, and moons, and
winters, long before it was reckoned by days, and
suns, and years. Moon<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> is a very old word. It was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">môna</span></em> in Anglo-Saxon, and was used there, not as a
feminine, but as a masculine; for the moon was a masculine
in all Teutonic languages, and it is only through
the influence of classical models that in English moon
has been changed into a feminine, and sun into a masculine.
It was a most unlucky assertion which Mr. Harris
made in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermes</span></span>, that all nations ascribe to the
sun a masculine, and to the moon a feminine gender.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
In Gothic moon is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mena</span></em>, which is a masculine. For
month we have in A.-S. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mónâdh</span></em>, in Gothic
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">menoth</span></em>,
both masculine. In Greek we find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mēn</span></em>, a
masculine, for month, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mēnē</span></em>,
a feminine, for moon. In Latin
we have the derivative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mensis</span></em>, month, and in
Sanskrit we find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâs</span></em> for moon, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâsa</span></em> for month, both
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
masculine.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Now this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâs</span></em> in Sanskrit is clearly derived
from a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ</span></em>, to measure, to mete. In Sanskrit, I
measure is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ-mi</span></em>; thou measurest,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ-si</span></em>; he measures,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ-ti</span></em> (or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mimî-te</span></em>). An
instrument of measuring is called in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ-tram</span></em>,
the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metron</span></em>, our
metre. Now if the moon was originally called by the
farmer the measurer, the ruler of days, and weeks, and
seasons, the regulator of the tides, the lord of their
festivals, and the herald of their public assemblies, it
is but natural that he should have been conceived as a
man, and not as the love-sick maiden which our modern
sentimental poetry has put in his place.

It was the sailor who, before intrusting his life and
goods to the winds and the waves of the ocean, watched
for the rising of those stars which he called the Sailing-stars
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pleiades</span></span>, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plein</span></em>, to sail.
Navigation in the Greek waters was considered safe after the return of
the Pleiades; and it closed when they disappeared.
The Latin name for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pleiades</span></span> is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vergiliæ</span></em>, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virga</span></em>, a sprout or twig. This name was given to
them by the Italian husbandman, because in Italy,
where they became visible about May, they marked
the return of summer.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> Another constellation, the
seven stars in the head of Taurus, received the name
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyades</span></span> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluviæ</span></em>
in Latin, because at the time
when they rose with the sun they were supposed to
announce rain. The astronomer retains these and
many other names; he still speaks of the pole of
heaven, of wandering and fixed stars,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> but he is apt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific
observation and classification, but were borrowed
from the language of those who themselves were wanderers
on the sea or in the desert, and to whom the
fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies,
stars driven in and fixed, by which they might hold
fast on the deep, as by heavenly anchors.

But although historically we are justified in saying
that the first geometrician was a ploughman, the first
botanist a gardener, the first mineralogist a miner, it
may reasonably be objected that in this early stage a
science is hardly a science yet: that measuring a field
is not geometry, that growing cabbages is very far
from botany, and that a butcher has no claim to the
title of comparative anatomist. This is perfectly true,
yet it is but right that each science should be reminded
of these its more humble beginnings, and of the practical
requirements which it was originally intended to
answer. A science, as Bacon says, should be a rich
storehouse for the glory of God, and the relief of
man's estate. Now, although it may seem as if in
the present high state of our society students were
enabled to devote their time to the investigation of
the facts and laws of nature, or to the contemplation
of the mysteries of the world of thought, without any
side-glance at the practical result of their labors, no
science and no art have long prospered and flourished
among us, unless they were in some way subservient
to the practical interests of society. It is true that a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lyell collects and arranges, a Faraday weighs and
analyzes, an Owen dissects and compares, a Herschel
observes and calculates, without any thought of the
immediate marketable results of their labors. But
there is a general interest which supports and enlivens
their researches, and that interest depends on the practical
advantages which society at large derives from
their scientific studies. Let it be known that the successive
strata of the geologist are a deception to the
miner, that the astronomical tables are useless to the
navigator, that chemistry is nothing but an expensive
amusement, of no use to the manufacturer and the farmer—and
astronomy, chemistry, and geology would
soon share the fate of alchemy and astrology. As long
as the Egyptian science excited the hopes of the invalid
by mysterious prescriptions (I may observe by the way
that the hieroglyphic signs of our modern prescriptions
have been traced back by Champollion to the real
hieroglyphics of Egypt<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>)—and as long as it instigated
the avarice of its patrons by the promise of the
discovery of gold, it enjoyed a liberal support at the
courts of princes, and under the roofs of monasteries.
Though alchemy did not lead to the discovery of gold,
it prepared the way to discoveries more valuable. The
same with astrology. Astrology was not such mere
imposition as it is generally supposed to have been. It
is counted as a science by so sound and sober a scholar
as Melancthon, and even Bacon allows it a place among
the sciences, though admitting that <span class="tei tei-q">“it had better intelligence
and confederacy with the imagination of man
than with his reason.”</span> In spite of the strong condemnation
which Luther pronounced against astrology,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
astrology continued to sway the destinies of Europe;
and a hundred years after Luther, the astrologer was the
counsellor of princes and generals, while the founder
of modern astronomy died in poverty and despair. In
our time the very rudiments of astrology are lost and
forgotten.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> Even real and useful arts, as soon as they
cease to be useful, die away, and their secrets are
sometimes lost beyond the hope of recovery. When
after the Reformation our churches and chapels were
divested of their artistic ornaments, in order to restore,
in outward appearance also, the simplicity and purity
of the Christian church, the colors of the painted windows
began to fade away, and have never regained
their former depth and harmony. The invention of
printing gave the death-blow to the art of ornamental
writing and of miniature-painting employed in the illumination
of manuscripts; and the best artists of the
present day despair of rivalling the minuteness, softness,
and brilliancy combined by the humble manufacturer
of the mediæval missal.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I speak somewhat feelingly on the necessity that
every science should answer some practical purpose,
because I am aware that the science of language has
but little to offer to the utilitarian spirit of our age.
It does not profess to help us in learning languages
more expeditiously, nor does it hold out any hope of
ever realizing the dream of one universal language.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It simply professes to teach what language is, and this
would hardly seem sufficient to secure for a new science
the sympathy and support of the public at large. There
are problems, however, which, though apparently of an
abstruse and merely speculative character, have exercised
a powerful influence for good or evil in the history of
mankind. Men before now have fought for an idea,
and have laid down their lives for a word; and many
of these problems which have agitated the world from
the earliest to our own times, belong properly to the
science of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mythology, which was the bane of the ancient world,
is in truth a disease of language. A myth means a
word, but a word which, from being a name or an attribute,
has been allowed to assume a more substantial
existence. Most of the Greek, the Roman, the Indian,
and other heathen gods are nothing but poetical names,
which were gradually allowed to assume a divine personality
never contemplated by their original inventors.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eos</span></em> was a name of the dawn before she became a goddess,
the wife of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tithonos</span></em>, or the dying day.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fatum</span></em>,
or fate, meant originally what had been spoken; and
before Fate became a power, even greater than Jupiter,
it meant that which had once been spoken by
Jupiter, and could never be changed,—not even by
Jupiter himself. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeus</span></em> originally meant the bright
heaven, in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dyaus</span></em>; and many of the stories
told of him as the supreme god, had a meaning only
as told originally of the bright heaven, whose rays,
like golden rain, descend on the lap of the earth, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Danae</span></em> of old, kept by her father in the dark prison of
winter. No one doubts that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Luna</span></em> was simply a name
of the moon; but so was likewise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucina</span></em>, both derived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lucere</span></em>, to shine.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecate</span></em>, too, was an old name of
the moon, the feminine of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hekatos</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hekatebolos</span></em>, the
far-darting sun; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pyrrha</span></em>, the Eve of the Greeks,
was nothing but a name of the red earth, and in
particular of Thessaly. This mythological disease,
though less virulent in modern languages, is by no
means extinct.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the Middle Ages the controversy between
Nominalism and Realism, which agitated the church
for centuries, and finally prepared the way for the
Reformation, was again, as its very name shows, a
controversy on names, on the nature of language, and
on the relation of words to our conceptions on one
side, and to the realities of the outer world on the
other. Men were called heretics for believing that
words such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justice</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em> expressed only conceptions
of our mind, not real things walking about in
broad daylight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In modern times the science of language has been
called in to settle some of the most perplexing political
and social questions. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nations and languages against
dynasties and treaties,”</span> this is what has remodelled,
and will remodel still more, the map of Europe; and
in America comparative philologists have been encouraged
to prove the impossibility of a common origin of
languages and races, in order to justify, by scientific
arguments, the unhallowed theory of slavery. Never
do I remember to have seen science more degraded
than on the title-page of an American publication in
which, among the profiles of the different races of
man, the profile of the ape was made to look more
human than that of the negro.

Lastly, the problem of the position of man on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
threshold between the worlds of matter and spirit has
of late assumed a very marked prominence among
the problems of the physical and mental sciences. It
has absorbed the thoughts of men who, after a long
life spent in collecting, observing, and analyzing, have
brought to its solution qualifications unrivalled in any
previous age; and if we may judge from the greater
warmth displayed in discussions ordinarily conducted
with the calmness of judges and not with the passion
of pleaders, it might seem, after all, as if the great
problems of our being, of the true nobility of our
blood, of our descent from heaven or earth, though
unconnected with anything that is commonly called
practical, have still retained a charm of their own—a
charm that will never lose its power on the mind,
and on the heart of man. Now, however much the
frontiers of the animal kingdom have been pushed forward,
so that at one time the line of demarcation between
animal and man seemed to depend on a mere
fold in the brain, there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> barrier which no one
has yet ventured to touch—the barrier of language.
Even those philosophers with whom
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">penser c'est sentir</span></em>,<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
who reduce all thought to feeling, and maintain that
we share the faculties which are the productive causes
of thought in common with beasts, are bound to confess
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as yet</span></em> no race of animals has produced a language.
Lord Monboddo, for instance, admits that as yet no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
animal has been discovered in the possession of language,
<span class="tei tei-q">“not even the beaver, who of all the animals
we know, that are not, like the orang-outangs, of our
own species, comes nearest to us in sagacity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Locke, who is generally classed together with these
materialistic philosophers, and who certainly vindicated
a large share of what had been claimed for the intellect
as the property of the senses, recognized most fully
the barrier which language, as such, placed between
man and brutes. <span class="tei tei-q">“This I may be positive in,”</span> he
writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the power of abstracting is not at all
in brutes, and that the having of general ideas is
that which puts a perfect distinction between man
and brutes. For it is evident we observe no footsteps
in these of making use of general signs for universal
ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that
they have not the faculty of abstracting or making
general ideas, since they have no use of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em> or any
other general signs.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, therefore, the science of language gives us an
insight into that which, by common consent, distinguishes
man from all other living beings; if it establishes
a frontier between man and the brute, which
can never be removed, it would seem to possess at
the present moment peculiar claims on the attention
of all who, while watching with sincere admiration
the progress of comparative physiology, yet consider
it their duty to enter their manly protest against a
revival of the shallow theories of Lord Monboddo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to return to our survey of the history of the
physical sciences. We had examined the empirical
stage through which every science has to pass. We
saw that, for instance, in botany, a man who has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
travelled through distant countries, who has collected
a vast number of plants, who knows their names,
their peculiarities, and their medicinal qualities, is
not yet a botanist, but only a herbalist, a lover of
plants, or what the Italians call a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dilettante</span></em>, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dilettare</span></em>,
to delight. The real science of plants, like
every other science, begins with the work of classification.
An empirical acquaintance with facts rises
to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon as the mind
discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions
the unity of an organic system. This discovery is
made by means of comparison and classification. We
cease to study each flower for its own sake; and by
continually enlarging the sphere of our observation,
we try to discover what is common to many and
offers those essential points on which groups or natural
classes may be established. These classes again,
in their more general features, are mutually compared;
new points of difference, or of similarity of a
more general and higher character, spring to view, and
enable us to discover classes of classes, or families.
And when the whole kingdom of plants has thus
been surveyed, and a simple tissue of names been
thrown over the garden of nature; when we can
lift it up, as it were, and view it in our mind as a
whole, as a system well defined and complete, we then
speak of the science of plants, or botany. We have
entered into altogether a new sphere of knowledge
where the individual is subject to the general, fact to
law; we discover thought, order, and purpose pervading
the whole realm of nature, and we perceive
the dark chaos of matter lighted up by the reflection
of a divine mind. Such views may be right or wrong.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Too hasty comparisons, or too narrow distinctions, may
have prevented the eye of the observer from discovering
the broad outlines of nature's plan. Yet every system,
however insufficient it may prove hereafter, is a step in
advance. If the mind of man is once impressed with
the conviction that there must be order and law everywhere,
it never rests again until all that seems irregular
has been eliminated, until the full beauty and harmony
of nature has been perceived, and the eye of man has
caught the eye of God beaming out from the midst of
all His works. The failures of the past prepare the
triumphs of the future.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, to recur to our former illustration, the systematic
arrangement of plants which bears the name
of Linnæus, and which is founded on the number
and character of the reproductive organs, failed to
bring out the natural order which pervades all that
grows and blossoms. Broad lines of demarcation
which unite or divide large tribes and families of
plants were invisible from his point of view. But in
spite of this, his work was not in vain. The fact that
plants in every part of the world belonged to one great
system was established once for all; and even in later
systems most of his classes and divisions have been preserved,
because the conformation of the reproductive
organs of plants happened to run parallel with other
more characteristic marks of true affinity.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> It is the
same in the history of astronomy. Although the Ptolemæan
system was a wrong one, yet even from its eccentric
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
point of view, laws were discovered determining
the true movements of the heavenly bodies. The
conviction that there remains something unexplained is
sure to lead to the discovery of our error. There can
be no error in nature; the error must be with us.
This conviction lived in the heart of Aristotle when,
in spite of his imperfect knowledge of nature, he declared
<span class="tei tei-q">“that there is in nature nothing interpolated or
without connection, as in a bad tragedy;”</span> and from
his time forward every new fact and every new system
have confirmed his faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The object of classification is clear. We understand
things if we can comprehend them; that is to say, if
we can grasp and hold together single facts, connect
isolated impressions, distinguish between what is essential
and what is merely accidental, and thus predicate
the general of the individual, and class the individual
under the general. This is the secret of all scientific
knowledge. Many sciences, while passing through this
second or classificatory stage, assume the title of comparative.
When the anatomist has finished the dissection
of numerous bodies, when he has given names to
each organ, and discovered the distinctive functions of
each, he is led to perceive similarity where at first he
saw dissimilarity only. He discovers in the lower animals
rudimentary indications of the more perfect organization
of the higher; and he becomes impressed with
the conviction that there is in the animal kingdom the
same order and purpose which pervades the endless
variety of plants or any other realm of nature. He
learns, if he did not know it before, that things were
not created at random or in a lump, but that there is
a scale which leads, by imperceptible degrees, from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lowest infusoria to the crowning work of nature,—man;
that all is the manifestation of one and the same
unbroken chain of creative thought, the work of one
and the same all-wise Creator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this way the second or classificatory leads us
naturally to the third or final stage—the theoretical,
or metaphysical. If the work of classification is properly
carried out, it teaches us that nothing exists in
nature by accident; that each individual belongs to
a species, each species to a genus; and that there are
laws which underlie the apparent freedom and variety
of all created things. These laws indicate to us the
presence of a purpose in the mind of the Creator; and
whereas the material world was looked upon by ancient
philosophers as a mere illusion, as an agglomerate of
atoms, or as the work of an evil principle, we now read
and interpret its pages as the revelation of a divine
power, and wisdom, and love. This has given to the
study of nature a new character. After the observer
has collected his facts, and after the classifier has placed
them in order, the student asks what is the origin and
what is the meaning of all this? and he tries to soar,
by means of induction, or sometimes even of divination,
into regions not accessible to the mere collector.
In this attempt the mind of man no doubt has frequently
met with the fate of Phaeton; but, undismayed
by failure, he asks again and again for his
father's steeds. It has been said that this so-called
philosophy of nature has never achieved anything;
that it has done nothing but prove that things must
be exactly as they had been found to be by the observer
and collector. Physical science, however, would
never have been what it is without the impulses which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it received from the philosopher, nay even from the
poet. <span class="tei tei-q">“At the limits of exact knowledge”</span> (I quote
the words of Humboldt), <span class="tei tei-q">“as from a lofty island-shore,
the eye loves to glance towards distant regions. The
images which it sees may be illusive; but, like the
illusive images which people imagined they had seen
from the Canaries or the Azores, long before the time
of Columbus, they may lead to the discovery of a new
world.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Copernicus, in the dedication of his work to Pope
Paul III. (it was commenced in 1517, finished 1530,
published 1543), confesses that he was brought to the
discovery of the sun's central position, and of the diurnal
motion of the earth, not by observation or analysis,
but by what he calls the feeling of a want of symmetry
in the Ptolemaic system. But who had told him that
there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be symmetry in all the movements of the
celestial bodies, or that complication was not more
sublime than simplicity? Symmetry and simplicity,
before they were discovered by the observer, were
postulated by the philosopher. The first idea of revolutionizing
the heavens was suggested to Copernicus,
as he tells us himself, by an ancient Greek philosopher,
by Philolaus, the Pythagorean. No doubt with
Philolaus the motion of the earth was only a guess, or,
if you like, a happy intuition. Nevertheless, if we
may trust the words of Copernicus, it is quite possible
that without that guess we should never have heard of
the Copernican system. Truth is not found by addition
and multiplication only. When speaking of Kepler,
whose method of reasoning has been considered as
unsafe and fantastic by his contemporaries as well as by
later astronomers, Sir David Brewster remarks very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truly, <span class="tei tei-q">“that, as an instrument of research, the influence
of imagination has been much overlooked by those
who have ventured to give laws to philosophy.”</span> The
torch of imagination is as necessary to him who looks
for truth, as the lamp of study. Kepler held both, and
more than that, he had the star of faith to guide him
in all things from darkness to light.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the history of the physical sciences, the three
stages which we have just described as the empirical,
the classificatory, and the theoretical, appear
generally in chronological order. I say, generally,
for there have been instances, as in the case just
quoted of Philolaus, where the results properly belonging
to the third have been anticipated in the
first stage. To the quick eye of genius one case may
be like a thousand, and one experiment, well chosen,
may lead to the discovery of an absolute law. Besides,
there are great chasms in the history of science.
The tradition of generations is broken by political or
ethnic earthquakes, and the work that was nearly finished
has frequently had to be done again from the
beginning, when a new surface had been formed for
the growth of a new civilization. The succession,
however, of these three stages is no doubt the natural
one, and it is very properly observed in the study of
every science. The student of botany begins as a
collector of plants. Taking each plant by itself, he
observes its peculiar character, its habitat, its proper
season, its popular or unscientific name. He learns to
distinguish between the roots, the stem, the leaves, the
flower, the calyx, the stamina, and pistils. He learns,
so to say, the practical grammar of the plant before
he can begin to compare, to arrange, and classify.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, no one can enter with advantage on the
third stage of any physical science without having
passed through the second. No one can study <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
plant, no one can understand the bearing of such a
work as, for instance, Professor Schleiden's <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of
the Plant,”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> who has not studied the life of plants in
the wonderful variety, and in the still more wonderful
order, of nature. These last and highest achievements
of inductive philosophy are possible only after the
way has been cleared by previous classification. The
philosopher must command his classes like regiments
which obey the order of their general. Thus alone
can the battle be fought and truth be conquered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this rapid glance at the history of the other
physical sciences, we now return to our own, the science
of language, in order to see whether it really is
a science, and whether it can be brought back to the
standard of the inductive sciences. We want to know
whether it has passed, or is still passing, through the
three phases of physical research; whether its progress
has been systematic or desultory, whether its method
has been appropriate or not. But before we do this, we
shall, I think, have to do something else. You may
have observed that I always took it for granted that
the science of language, which is best known in this
country by the name of comparative philology, is one
of the physical sciences, and that therefore its method
ought to be the same as that which has been followed
with so much success in botany, geology, anatomy,
and other branches of the study of nature. In the
history of the physical sciences, however, we look in
vain for a place assigned to comparative philology, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its very name would seem to show that it belongs to
quite a different sphere of human knowledge. There
are two great divisions of human knowledge, which,
according to their subject-matter, are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em>. Physical science deals with the works
of God, historical science with the works of man.
Now if we were to judge by its name, comparative
philology, like classical philology, would seem to take
rank, not as a physical, but as an historical science,
and the proper method to be applied to it would be
that which is followed in the history of art, of law,
of politics, and religion. However, the title of comparative
philology must not be allowed to mislead us.
It is difficult to say by whom that title was invented;
but all that can be said in defence of it is, that the
founders of the science of language were chiefly scholars
or philologists, and that they based their inquiries
into the nature and laws of language on a comparison
of as many facts as they could collect within their own
special spheres of study. Neither in Germany, which
may well be called the birthplace of this science, nor
in France, where it has been cultivated with brilliant
success, has that title been adopted. It will not be
difficult to show that, although the science of language
owes much to the classical scholar, and though in return
it has proved of great use to him, yet comparative
philology has really nothing whatever in common
with philology in the usual meaning of the word.
Philology, whether classical or oriental, whether treating
of ancient or modern, of cultivated or barbarous
languages, is an historical science. Language is here
treated simply as a means. The classical scholar uses
Greek or Latin, the oriental scholar Hebrew or Sanskrit,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or any other language, as a key to an understanding
of the literary monuments which by-gone ages have
bequeathed to us, as a spell to raise from the tomb of
time the thoughts of great men in different ages and
different countries, and as a means ultimately to trace
the social, moral, intellectual, and religious progress of
the human race. In the same manner, if we study
living languages, it is not for their own sake that we
acquire grammars and vocabularies. We do so on
account of their practical usefulness. We use them
as letters of introduction to the best society or to the
best literature of the leading nations of Europe. In
comparative philology the case is totally different. In
the science of language, languages are not treated as
a means; language itself becomes the sole object of
scientific inquiry. Dialects which have never produced
any literature at all, the jargons of savage tribes,
the clicks of the Hottentots, and the vocal modulations
of the Indo-Chinese are as important, nay, for the solution
of some of our problems, more important, than
the poetry of Homer, or the prose of Cicero. We do
not want to know languages, we want to know language;
what language is, how it can form a vehicle
or an organ of thought; we want to know its origin,
its nature, its laws; and it is only in order to arrive
at that knowledge that we collect, arrange, and classify
all the facts of language that are within our reach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here I must protest, at the very outset of these
lectures, against the supposition that the student of
language must necessarily be a great linguist. I shall
have to speak to you in the course of these lectures of
hundreds of languages, some of which, perhaps, you
may never have heard mentioned even by name. Do
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not suppose that I know these languages as you know
Greek or Latin, French or German. In that sense I
know indeed very few languages, and I never aspired
to the fame of a Mithridates or a Mezzofanti. It is
impossible for a student of language to acquire a practical
knowledge of all tongues with which he has to
deal. He does not wish to speak the Kachikal language,
of which a professorship was lately founded in
the University of Guatemala,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> or to acquire the elegancies
of the idiom of the Tcheremissians; nor is it his
ambition to explore the literature of the Samoyedes, or
the New-Zealanders. It is the grammar and the dictionary
which form the subject of his inquiries. These
he consults and subjects to a careful analysis, but he
does not encumber his memory with paradigms of
nouns and verbs, or with long lists of words which
have never been used in any work of literature. It is
true, no doubt, that no language will unveil the whole
of its wonderful structure except to the scholar who
has studied it thoroughly and critically in a number
of literary works representing the various periods of
its growth. Nevertheless, short lists of vocables, and
imperfect sketches of a grammar, are in many instances
all that the student can expect to obtain, or
can hope to master and to use for the purposes he has
in view. He must learn to make the best of this fragmentary
information, like the comparative anatomist,
who frequently learns his lessons from the smallest
fragments of fossil bones, or the vague pictures of
animals brought home by unscientific travellers. If it
were necessary for the comparative philologist to acquire
a critical or practical acquaintance with all the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
languages which form the subject of his inquiries, the
science of language would simply be an impossibility.
But we do not expect the botanist to be an experienced
gardener, or the geologist a miner, or the ichthyologist
a practical fisherman. Nor would it be reasonable to
object in the science of language to the same division
of labor which is necessary for the successful cultivation
of subjects much less comprehensive. Though
much of what we might call the realm of language is
lost to us forever, though whole periods in the history
of language are by necessity withdrawn from our
observation, yet the mass of human speech that lies
before us, whether in the petrified strata of ancient
literature or in the countless variety of living languages
and dialects, offers a field as large, if not larger,
than any other branch of physical research. It is
impossible to fix the exact number of known languages,
but their number can hardly be less than nine hundred.
That this vast field should never have excited
the curiosity of the natural philosopher before the
beginning of our century may seem surprising, more
surprising even than the indifference with which former
generations treated the lessons which even the
stones seemed to teach of the life still throbbing in the
veins and on the very surface of the earth. The saying
that "familiarity breeds contempt" would seem
applicable to the subjects of both these sciences. The
gravel of our walks hardly seemed to deserve a scientific
treatment, and the language which every plough-boy
can speak could not be raised without an effort to
the dignity of a scientific problem. Man had studied
every part of nature, the mineral treasures in the
bowels of the earth, the flowers of each season, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
animals of every continent, the laws of storms, and
the movements of the heavenly bodies; he had analyzed
every substance, dissected every organism, he
knew every bone and muscle, every nerve and fibre of
his own body to the ultimate elements which compose
his flesh and blood; he had meditated on the nature of
his soul, on the laws of his mind, and tried to penetrate
into the last causes of all being—and yet language,
without the aid of which not even the first step
in this glorious career could have been made, remained
unnoticed. Like a veil that hung too close over the
eye of the human mind, it was hardly perceived. In
an age when the study of antiquity attracted the most
energetic minds, when the ashes of Pompeii were
sifted for the playthings of Roman life; when parchments
were made to disclose, by chemical means, the
erased thoughts of Grecian thinkers; when the tombs
of Egypt were ransacked for their sacred contents, and
the palaces of Babylon and Nineveh forced to surrender
the clay diaries of Nebuchadnezzar; when everything,
in fact, that seemed to contain a vestige of the
early life of man was anxiously searched for and carefully
preserved in our libraries and museums,—language,
which in itself carries us back far beyond the
cuneiform literature of Assyria and Babylonia, and the
hieroglyphic documents of Egypt; which connects ourselves,
through an unbroken chain of speech, with the
very ancestors of our race, and still draws its life from
the first utterances of the human mind,—language,
the living and speaking witness of the whole history
of our race, was never cross-examined by the student
of history, was never made to disclose its secrets until
questioned and, so to say, brought back to itself within
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the last fifty years, by the genius of a Humboldt,
Bopp, Grimm, Bunsen, and others. If you consider
that, whatever view we take of the origin and dispersion
of language, nothing new has ever been added to
the substance of language, that all its changes have
been changes of form, that no new root or radical has
ever been invented by later generations, as little as one
single element has ever been added to the material
world in which we live; if you bear in mind that in
one sense, and in a very just sense, we may be said to
handle the very words which issued from the mouth of
the son of God, when he gave names to <span class="tei tei-q">“all cattle,
and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the
field,”</span> you will see, I believe, that the science of language
has claims on your attention, such as few
sciences can rival or excel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having thus explained the manner in which I intend
to treat the science of language, I hope in my
next lecture to examine the objections of those philosophers
who see in language nothing but a contrivance
devised by human skill for the more expeditious
communication of our thoughts, and who would wish
to see it treated, not as a production of nature, but
as a work of human art.

The History Of Language.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In claiming for the science of language a place
among the physical sciences, I was prepared to meet
with many objections. The circle of the physical
sciences seemed closed, and it was not likely that a
new claimant should at once be welcomed among the
established branches and scions of the ancient aristocracy
of learning.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first objection which was sure to be raised on
the part of such sciences as botany, geology, or physiology
is this:—Language is the work of man; it
was invented by man as a means of communicating
his thoughts, when mere looks and gestures proved
inefficient; and it was gradually, by the combined
efforts of succeeding generations, brought to that perfection
which we admire in the idiom of the Bible, the
Vedas, the Koran, and in the poetry of Homer, Virgil,
Dante, and Shakespeare. Now it is perfectly true that
if language be the work of man, in the same sense in
which a statue, or a temple, or a poem, or a law are
properly called the works of man, the science of language
would have to be classed as an historical science.
We should have a history of language as we have a
history of art, of poetry, and of jurisprudence, but we
could not claim for it a place side by side with the
various branches of Natural History. It is true, also,
that if you consult the works of the most distinguished
modern philosophers you will find that whenever they
speak of language, they take it for granted that language
is a human invention, that words are artificial
signs, and that the varieties of human speech arose
from different nations agreeing on different sounds as
the most appropriate signs of their different ideas.
This view of the origin of language was so powerfully
advocated by the leading philosophers of the last
century, that it has retained an undisputed currency
even among those who, on almost every other point,
are strongly opposed to the teaching of that school.
A few voices, indeed, have been raised to protest
against the theory of language being originally invented
by man. But they, in their zeal to vindicate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the divine origin of language, seem to have been carried
away so far as to run counter to the express
statements of the Bible. For in the Bible it is not
the Creator who gives names to all things, but
Adam. <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the ground,”</span> we read, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord
God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl
of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam
called every living creature, that was the name
thereof.”</span><a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
But with the exception of this small class of
philosophers, more orthodox even than the Bible,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
the generally received opinion on the origin of language
is that which was held by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Locke</span></span>, which was
powerfully advocated by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith</span></span> in his Essay on
the Origin of Language, appended to his Treatise on
Moral Sentiments, and which was adopted with slight
modifications by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dugald Stewart</span></span>. According to them,
man must have lived for a time in a state of mutism,
his only means of communication consisting in gestures
of the body, and in the changes of countenance,
till at last, when ideas multiplied that could no longer
be pointed at with the fingers, <span class="tei tei-q">“they found it necessary
to invent artificial signs of which the meaning was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fixed by mutual agreement.”</span> We need not dwell on
minor differences of opinion as to the exact process
by which this artificial language is supposed to have
been formed. Adam Smith would wish us to believe
that the first artificial words were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbs</span></em>. Nouns, he
thinks, were of less urgent necessity because things
could be pointed at or imitated, whereas mere actions,
such as are expressed by verbs, could not. He therefore
supposes that when people saw a wolf coming,
they pointed at him, and simply cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
comes.”</span> Dugald Stewart, on the contrary, thinks
that the first artificial words were nouns, and that
the verbs were supplied by gesture; that, therefore,
when people saw a wolf coming, they did not cry
<span class="tei tei-q">“He comes,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“Wolf, Wolf,”</span> leaving the rest to
be imagined.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whether the verb or the noun was the first to
be invented is of little importance; nor is it possible
for us, at the very beginning of our inquiry into the
nature of language, to enter upon a minute examination
of a theory which represents language as a work
of human art, and as established by mutual agreement
as a medium of communication. While fully
admitting that if this theory were true, the science
of language would not come within the pale of the
physical sciences, I must content myself for the present
with pointing out that no one has yet explained
how, without language, a discussion on the merits of
each word, such as must necessarily have preceded a
mutual agreement, could have been carried on. But
as it is the object of these lectures to prove that language
is not a work of human art, in the same sense
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as painting, or building, or writing, or printing, I must
ask to be allowed, in this preliminary stage, simply to
enter my protest against a theory, which, though still
taught in the schools, is, nevertheless, I believe, without
a single fact to support its truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are other objections besides this which
would seem to bar the admission of the science of
language to the circle of the physical sciences. Whatever
the origin of language may have been, it has
been remarked with a strong appearance of truth,
that language has a history of its own, like art, like
law, like religion; and that, therefore, the science of
language belongs to the circle of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em>, or, as
they used to be called, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>, in contradistinction
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> sciences. It is a well-known fact,
which recent researches have not shaken, that nature
is incapable of progress or improvement. The flower
which the botanist observes to-day was as perfect
from the beginning. Animals, which are endowed
with what is called an artistic instinct, have never
brought that instinct to a higher degree of perfection.
The hexagonal cells of the bee are not more regular
in the nineteenth century than at any earlier period,
and the gift of song has never, as far as we know,
been brought to a higher perfection by our nightingale
than by the Philomelo of the Greeks. <span class="tei tei-q">“Natural
History,”</span> to quote Dr. Whewell's words,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“when systematically
treated, excludes all that is historical, for it
classes objects by their permanent and universal properties,
and has nothing to do with the narration of
particular or casual facts.”</span> Now, if we consider the
large number of tongues spoken in different parts of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the world with all their dialectic and provincial varieties,
if we observe the great changes which each
of these tongues has undergone in the course of centuries,
how Latin was changed into Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, Provençal, French, Wallachian, and Roumansch;
how Latin again, together with Greek, and
the Celtic, the Teutonic, and Slavonic languages, together
likewise with the ancient dialects of India and
Persia, must have sprung from an earlier language, the
mother of the whole Indo-European or Aryan family
of speech; if we see how Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac,
with several minor dialects, are but different impressions
of one and the same common type, and must all
have flowed from the same source, the original language
of the Semitic race; and if we add to these two,
the Aryan and Semitic, at least one more well-established
class of languages, the Turanian, comprising the
dialects of the nomad races scattered over Central and
Northern Asia, the Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> Samoyedic,
and Finnic, all radii from one common centre
of speech:—if we watch this stream of language rolling
on through centuries in these three mighty arms,
which, before they disappear from our sight in the far
distance, clearly show a convergence towards one common
source: it would seem, indeed, as if there were an
historical life inherent in language, and as if both the
will of man and the power of time could tell, if not on
its substance, at least on its form. And even if the
mere local varieties of speech were not considered sufficient
ground for excluding language from the domain
of natural science, there would still remain the greater
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficulty of reconciling with the recognized principles
of physical science the historical changes affecting
every one of these varieties. Every part of nature,
whether mineral, plant, or animal, is the same in kind
from the beginning to the end of its existence, whereas
few languages could be recognized as the same after
the lapse of but a thousand years. The language of
Alfred is so different from the English of the present
day that we have to study it in the same manner as
we study Greek and Latin. We can read Milton and
Bacon, Shakespeare and Hooker; we can make out
Wycliffe and Chaucer; but, when we come to the
English of the thirteenth century, we can but guess
its meaning, and we fail even in this with works previous
to the Ormulum and Layamon. The historical
changes of language may be more or less rapid, but
they take place at all times and in all countries. They
have reduced the rich and powerful idiom of the poets
of the Veda to the meagre and impure jargon of the
modern Sepoy. They have transformed the language
of the Zend-Avesta and of the mountain records of
Behistún into that of Firdusi and the modern Persians;
the language of Virgil into that of Dante, the language
of Ulfilas into that of Charlemagne, the language of
Charlemagne into that of Goethe. We have reason
to believe that the same changes take place with even
greater violence and rapidity in the dialects of savage
tribes, although, in the absence of a written literature, it
is extremely difficult to obtain trustworthy information.
But in the few instances where careful observations
have been made on this interesting subject, it has been
found that among the wild and illiterate tribes of Siberia,
Africa, and Siam, two or three generations are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sufficient to change the whole aspect of their dialects.
The languages of highly civilized nations, on the
contrary, become more and more stationary, and seem
sometimes almost to lose their power of change. Where
there is a classical literature, and where its language is
spread to every town and village, it seems almost impossible
that any further changes should take place.
Nevertheless, the language of Rome, for so many centuries
the queen of the whole civilized world, was deposed
by the modern Romance dialects, and the ancient
Greek was supplanted in the end by the modern Romaic.
And though the art of printing and the wide
diffusion of Bibles, and Prayer-books, and newspapers
have acted as still more powerful barriers to arrest the
constant flow of human speech, we may see that the
language of the authorized version of the Bible, though
perfectly intelligible, is no longer the spoken language
of England. In Booker's Scripture and Prayer-book
Glossary<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> the number of words or senses of words
which have become obsolete since 1611, amount to 388,
or nearly one fifteenth part of the whole number of
words used in the Bible. Smaller changes, changes
of accent and meaning, the reception of new, and the
dropping of old words, we may watch as taking place
under our own eyes. Rogers<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> said that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cóntemplate</span></em>

no one is startled by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cóntemplate</span></em> instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contémplate</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bálcony</span></em> has become more usual than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">balcóny</span></em>.

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">buss</span></em> for omnibus, and even a verb such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to shunt</span></em>
tremble still on the boundary line between the vulgar
and the literary idioms. Though the grammatical
changes that have taken place since the publication
of the authorized version are yet fewer in number,
still we may point out some. The termination of the
third person singular in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">th</span></em> is now entirely replaced by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>. No one now says <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he liveth</span></em>, but only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he lives</span></em>.
Several of the irregular imperfects and participles have assumed
a new form. No one now uses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he spake</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he
drave</span></em>, instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he spoke</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he drove</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holpen</span></em> is replaced
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">helped</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holden</span></em> by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">held</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shapen</span></em>
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shaped</span></em>.
The distinction between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ye</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>, the former being
reserved for the nominative, the latter for all the other
cases, is given up in modern English; and what is apparently
a new grammatical form, the possessive pronoun
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em>, has sprung into life since the beginning of the
seventeenth century. It never occurs in the Bible;
and though it is used three or four times by Shakespeare,
Ben Jonson does not recognize it as yet in his
English Grammar.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>

It is argued, therefore, that as language, differing
thereby from all other productions of nature, is liable
to historical alterations, it is not fit to be treated in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same manner as the subject-matter of all the other
physical sciences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is something very plausible in this objection,
but if we examine it more carefully, we shall find
that it rests entirely on a confusion of terms. We
must distinguish between historical change and natural
growth. Art, science, philosophy, and religion all have
a history; language, or any other production of nature,
admits only of growth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us consider, first, that although there is a continuous
change in language, it is not in the power of
man either to produce or to prevent it. We might
think as well of changing the laws which control the
circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to our
height, as of altering the laws of speech, or inventing
new words according to our own pleasure. As man is
the lord of nature only if he knows her laws and submits
to them, the poet and the philosopher become the lords
of language only if they know its laws and obey them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the Emperor Tiberius had made a mistake,
and was reproved for it by Marcellus, another grammarian
of the name of Capito, who happened to be present,
remarked that what the emperor said was good
Latin, or, if it were not, it would soon be so. Marcellus,
more of a grammarian than a courtier, replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Capito is a liar; for, Cæsar, thou canst give the
Roman citizenship to men, but not to words.”</span> A similar
anecdote is told of the German Emperor Sigismund.
When presiding at the Council of Costnitz,
he addressed the assembly in a Latin speech, exhorting
them to eradicate the schism of the Hussites.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Videte Patres,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“ut eradicetis schismam
Hussitarum.”</span> He was very unceremoniously called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to order by a monk, who called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Serenissime Rex,
schisma est generis neutri.”</span><a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> The emperor, however,
without losing his presence of mind, asked the impertinent
monk, <span class="tei tei-q">“How do you know it?”</span> The old
Bohemian school-master replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alexander Gallus
says so.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And who is Alexander Gallus?”</span> the emperor
rejoined. The monk replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“He was a monk.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said the emperor, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I am Emperor of
Rome; and my word, I trust, will be as good as the
word of any monk.”</span> No doubt the laughers were
with the emperor; but for all that,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">schisma</span></em> remained
a neuter, and not even an emperor could change its
gender or termination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The idea that language can be changed and improved
by man is by no means a new one. We know
that Protagoras, an ancient Greek philosopher, after
laying down some laws on gender, actually began to find
fault with the text of Homer, because it did not agree
with his rules. But here, as in every other instance,
the attempt proved unavailing. Try to alter the smallest
rule of English, and you will find that it is physically
impossible. There is apparently a very small
difference between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">much</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>, but you can hardly
ever put one in the place of the other. You can say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am very happy,”</span> but not <span class="tei tei-q">“I am much happy,”</span>
though you may say <span class="tei tei-q">“I am most happy.”</span> On the
contrary, you can say <span class="tei tei-q">“I am much misunderstood,”</span>
but not <span class="tei tei-q">“I am very misunderstood.”</span> Thus the western
Romance dialects, Spanish and Portuguese, together
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Wallachian, can only employ the Latin
word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magis</span></em> for forming
comparatives:—Sp. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mas
dulce</span></em>; Port. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mais doce</span></em>;
Wall, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mai dulce</span></em>; while
French, Provençal, and Italian only allow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of plus</span></em> for
the same purpose: Ital. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">più dolce</span></em>;
Prov. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus dous</span></em>;
Fr. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus doux</span></em>.
It is by no means impossible, however,
that this distinction between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>, which is now used
with adjectives only, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">much</span></em>, which precedes participles,
should disappear in time. In fact, <span class="tei tei-q">“very pleased”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“very delighted”</span> are Americanisms which may
be heard even in this country. But if that change
take place, it will not be by the will of any individual,
nor by the mutual agreement of any large number of
men, but rather in spite of the exertions of grammarians
and academies. And here you perceive the first
difference between history and growth. An emperor
may change the laws of society, the forms of religion,
the rules of art: it is in the power of one generation,
or even of one individual, to raise an art to the highest
pitch of perfection, while the next may allow it to
lapse, till a new genius takes it up again with renewed
ardor. In all this we have to deal with the conscious
acts of individuals, and we therefore move on historical
ground. If we compare the creations of Michael Angelo
or Raphael with the statues and frescoes of ancient
Rome, we can speak of a history of art. We can
connect two periods separated by thousands of years
through the works of those who handed on the traditions
of art from century to century; but we shall
never meet with that continuous and unconscious
growth which connects the language of Plautus with
that of Dante. The process through which language
is settled and unsettled combines in one the two opposite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elements of necessity and free will. Though the
individual seems to be the prime agent in producing
new words and new grammatical forms, he is so only
after his individuality has been merged in the common
action of the family, tribe, or nation to which he belongs.
He can do nothing by himself, and the first
impulse to a new formation in language, though given
by an individual, is mostly, if not always, given without
premeditation, nay, unconsciously. The individual,
as such, is powerless, and the results apparently
produced by him depend on laws beyond his control,
and on the co-operation of all those who form together
with him one class, one body, or one organic whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, though it is easy to show, as we have just done,
that language cannot be changed or moulded by the
taste, the fancy, or genius of man, it is very difficult to
explain what causes the growth of language. Ever
since Horace it has been usual to compare the growth of
languages with the growth of trees. But comparisons
are treacherous things. What do we know of the real
causes of the growth of a tree, and what can we gain
by comparing things which we do not quite understand
with things which we understand even less? Many
people speak, for instance, of the terminations of the
verb, as if they sprouted out from the root as from
their parent stock.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> But what ideas can they connect
with such expressions? If we must compare language
with a tree, there is one point which may be illustrated
by this comparison, and this is that neither language
nor the tree can exist or grow by itself. Without the
soil, without air and light, the tree could not live; it
could not even be conceived to live. It is the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with language. Language cannot exist by itself; it
requires a soil on which to grow, and that soil is the
human soul. To speak of language as a thing by itself,
as living a life of its own, as growing to maturity,
producing offspring, and dying away, is sheer mythology;
and though we cannot help using metaphorical
expressions, we should always be on our guard, when
engaged in inquiries like the present, against being
carried away by the very words which we are using.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, what we call the growth of language comprises
two processes which should be carefully distinguished,
though they may be at work simultaneously. These
two processes I call,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialectical Regeneration.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phonetic Decay.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I begin with the second, as the more obvious, though
in reality its operations are mostly subsequent to the
operations of dialectical regeneration. I must ask you
at present to take it for granted that everything in
language had originally a meaning. As language can
have no other object but to express our meaning, it
might seem to follow almost by necessity that language
should contain neither more nor less than what is required
for that purpose. It would also seem to follow
that if language contains no more than what is necessary
for conveying a certain meaning, it would be
impossible to modify any part of it without defeating
its very purpose. This is really the case in some languages.
In Chinese, for instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em> is expressed by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shĭ</span></em>. It would be impossible to change
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shĭ</span></em> in the slightest
way without making it unfit to express <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em>. If
instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shĭ</span></em>
we pronounced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t'sĭ</span></em>, this would mean
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em>, but not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em>. But now, suppose we wished to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
express double the quantity of ten, twice ten, or twenty.
We should in Chinese take <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eúl</span></em>, which is two,
put it before <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shĭ</span></em>, and say
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eúl-shĭ</span></em>, twenty. The same caution
which applied to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shĭ</span></em>, applies again to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eúl-shĭ</span></em>. As soon
as you change it, by adding or dropping a single letter,
it is no longer twenty, but either something else or
nothing. We find exactly the same in other languages
which, like Chinese, are called monosyllabic. In
Tibetan, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chu</span></em> is ten,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nyi</span></em> two;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nyi-chu</span></em>, twenty. In
Burmese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">she</span></em> is ten,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nhit</span></em> two;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nhit-she</span></em>, twenty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how is it in English, or in Gothic, or in Greek
and Latin, or in Sanskrit? We do not say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two-ten</span></em> in
English, nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duo-decem</span></em>
in Latin, nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi-da'sa</span></em> in Sanskrit.

Now here we see, first, that the Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin, are only local modifications of one and the same
original word; whereas the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twenty</span></em> is a new
compound, the Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tvai tigjus</span></em> (two decads), the
Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tuêntig</span></em>, framed from Teutonic materials;
a product, as we shall see, of Dialectical Regeneration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We next observe that the first part of the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em> and of the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vin'sati</span></em> contains the same
number, which from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi</span></em> has been
reduced to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi</span></em>. This
is not very extraordinary; for the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></em>, twice,
which you still hear at our concerts, likewise stands
for an original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvis</span></em>, the English
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>, the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dis</span></em>.
This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dis</span></em>
appears again as a Latin preposition, meaning
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a-two</span></em>; so that, for instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discussion</span></em> means, originally,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
striking a-two, different from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">percussion</span></em>, which
means striking through and through. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Discussion</span></em> is,
in fact, the cracking of a nut in order to get at its
kernel. Well, the same word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi</span></em>, we have in
the Latin word for twenty, which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi-ginti</span></em>,
the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vin-'sati</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It can likewise be proved that the second part of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>
is a corruption of the old word for ten. Ten,
in Sanskrit, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'san</span></em>;
from it is derived <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'sati</span></em>, a decad;
and this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'sati</span></em> was again reduced
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">'sati</span></em>; thus
giving us with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi</span></em> for
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi</span></em>, two, the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi'sati</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vin'sati</span></em>, twenty.
The Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>, the
Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eikati</span></em>,
owe their origin to the same process.

Now consider the immense difference—I do not
mean in sound, but in character—between two such
words as the Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eúl-shĭ</span></em>,
two-ten, or twenty, and
those mere cripples of words which we meet with
in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. In Chinese there is
neither too much, nor too little. The word speaks
for itself, and requires no commentary. In Sanskrit,
on the contrary, the most essential parts of the two
component elements are gone, and what remains is a
kind of metamorphic agglomerate which cannot be
understood without a most minute microscopic analysis.
Here, then, you have an instance of what is
meant by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phonetic corruption</span></em>; and you will perceive
how, not only the form, but the whole nature of language
is destroyed by it. As soon as phonetic corruption
shows itself in a language, that language has lost
what we considered to be the most essential character
of all human speech, namely, that every part of it
should have a meaning. The people who spoke Sanskrit
were as little aware that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vin'sati</span></em> meant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice ten</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as a Frenchman is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vingt</span></em>
contains the remains of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deux</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dix</span></em>.
Language, therefore, has entered into a
new stage as soon as it submits to the attacks of phonetic
change. The life of language has become benumbed
and extinct in those words or portions of
words which show the first traces of this phonetic
mould. Henceforth those words or portions of words
can be kept up only artificially or by tradition; and,
what is important, a distinction is henceforth established
between what is substantial or radical, and
what is merely formal or grammatical in words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For let us now take another instance, which will
make it clearer, how phonetic corruption leads to the
first appearance of so-called grammatical forms. We
are not in the habit of looking on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twenty</span></em> as the plural
or dual of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em>. But how was a plural originally
formed? In Chinese, which from the first has guarded
most carefully against the taint of phonetic corruption,
the plural is formed in the most sensible manner. Thus,
man in Chinese is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kiai</span></em> means the whole or totality.
This added to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin</span></em> gives
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin-kiai</span></em>, which is the
plural of man. There are other words which are
used for the same purpose in Chinese; for instance,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">péi</span></em>, which means a class. Hence,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ĭ</span></em>, a stranger, followed
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">péi</span></em>, class, gives
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ĭ-péi</span></em>, strangers. We have
similar plurals in English, but we do not reckon them
as grammatical forms. Thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man-kind</span></em> is formed exactly
like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ĭ-péi</span></em>, stranger-kind;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christendom</span></em> is the same
as all Christians, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clergy</span></em> is synonymous
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clerici</span></em>.
The same process is followed in other cognate languages.
In Tibetan the plural is formed by the addition
of such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kun</span></em>, all, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t'sogs</span></em>,
multitude.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Even the numerals, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hundred</span></em>, are used for the
same purpose. And here again, as long as these words
are fully understood and kept alive, they resist phonetic
corruption; but the moment they lose, so to say, their
presence of mind, phonetic corruption sets in, and as
soon as phonetic corruption has commenced its ravages,
those portions of a word which it affects retain
a merely artificial or conventional existence, and dwindle
down to grammatical terminations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am afraid I should tax your patience too much
were I to enter here on an analysis of the grammatical
terminations in Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin, in order to
show how these terminations arose out of independent
words, which were slowly reduced to mere dust by the
constant wear and tear of speech. But in order to
explain how the principle of phonetic decay leads to
the formation of grammatical terminations, let us look
to languages with which we are more familiar. Let us
take the French adverb. We are told by French grammarians<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
that in order to form adverbs we have to add
the termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ment</span></em>. Thus
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bon</span></em>, good, we form
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bonnement</span></em>, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vrai</span></em>, true,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vraiment</span></em>. This termination
does not exist in Latin. But we meet in Latin<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> with
expressions such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bonâ mente</span></em>, in good faith.
We read in Ovid, <span class="tei tei-q">“Insistam forti mente,”</span> I shall insist
with a strong mind or will, I shall insist strongly; in
French, <span class="tei tei-q">“J'insisterai fortement.”</span> Therefore, what
has happened in the growth of Latin, or in the change
of Latin into French, is simply this: in phrases such
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forti mente</span></em>,
the last word was no longer felt as a distinct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
word, and it lost at the same time its distinct pronunciation.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mente</span></em>, the ablative of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mens</span></em>, was changed
into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ment</span></em>,
and was preserved as a merely formal element,
as the termination of adverbs, even in cases
where a recollection of the original meaning of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mente</span></em>
(with a mind), would have rendered its employment
perfectly impossible. If we say in French that a hammer
falls <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lourdement</span></em>, we little suspect that we
ascribe to a piece of iron a heavy mind. In Italian, though
the adverbial termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mente</span></em> in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">claramente</span></em> is no
longer felt as a distinct word, it has not as yet been
affected by phonetic corruption; and in Spanish it is
sometimes used as a distinct word, though even then it
cannot be said to have retained its distinct meaning.
Thus, instead of saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“claramente, concisamente y
elegantemente,”</span> it is more elegant to say in Spanish,
<span class="tei tei-q">“clara, concisa y elegante mente.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is difficult to form any conception of the extent
to which the whole surface of a language may be altered
by what we have just described as phonetic
change. Think that in the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vingt</span></em> you have
the same elements as in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deux</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dix</span></em>; that the second
part of the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">douze</span></em>, twelve, represents the
Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decim</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duodecim</span></em>;
that the final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">te</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trente</span></em>
was originally the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ginta</span></em> in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">triginta</span></em>, which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ginta</span></em>
was again a derivation and abbreviation of the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'sa</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'sati</span></em>, ten. Then consider how early this
phonetic disease must have broken out. For in the
same manner as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vingt</span></em> in French, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">veinte</span></em> in Spanish, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">venti</span></em> in Italian presuppose the more primitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>
which we find in Latin, so this Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>, together
with the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eikati</span></em>, and the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vin'sati</span></em> presuppose
an earlier language from which they are in turn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
derived, and in which, previous to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>, there must
have been a more primitive form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi-ginti</span></em>, and previous
to this again, another compound as clear and intelligible
as the Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eúl-shĭ</span></em>, consisting of the ancient
Aryan names for two, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dvi</span></em>, and ten, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">da'sati</span></em>. Such is
the virulence of this phonetic change, that it will sometimes
eat away the whole body of a word, and leave
nothing behind but decayed fragments. Thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sister</span></em>,
which in Sanskrit is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">svasar</span></em>,<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> appears in Pehlvi and in
Ossetian as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cho</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Daughter</span></em>,
which in Sanskrit is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duhitar</span></em>,
has dwindled down in Bohemian to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dci</span></em> (pronounced
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tsi</span></em>).<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
Who would believe that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tear</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">larme</span></em> are derived
from the same source; that the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">même</span></em>
contains the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">semetipsissimus</span></em>; that in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aujourd'hui</span></em>
we have the Latin word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dies</span></em> twice!<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> Who would
recognize the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater</span></em> in the Armenian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hayr</span></em>? Yet
we make no difficulty about identifying <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">père</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater</span></em>;
and as several initial h's in Armenian correspond to an
original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">het</span></em> = <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pes</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pedis</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hing</span></em> = πέντε; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hour</span></em> = πῦρ),
it follows that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hayr</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater</span></em>.<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>

We are accustomed to call these changes the growth
of language, but it would be more appropriate to call
this process of phonetic change decay, and thus to distinguish
it from the second or dialectical process which
we must now examine, and which involves, as you will
see, a more real principle of growth.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

regeneration</span></em> we must first see clearly what we mean by
dialect. We saw before that language has no independent
substantial existence. Language exists in
man, it lives in being spoken, it dies with each word
that is pronounced, and is no longer heard. It is a
mere accident that language should ever have been
reduced to writing, and have been made the vehicle
of a written literature. Even now the largest number
of languages have produced no literature. Among
the numerous tribes of Central Asia, Africa, America,
and Polynesia, language still lives in its natural state,
in a state of continual combustion; and it is there that
we must go if we wish to gain an insight into the
growth of human speech previous to its being arrested
by any literary interference. What we are accustomed
to call languages, the literary idioms of Greece, and
Rome, and India, of Italy, France, and Spain, must
be considered as artificial, rather than as natural forms
of speech. The real and natural life of language is in
its dialects, and in spite of the tyranny exercised by
the classical or literary idioms, the day is still very far
off which is to see the dialects, even of such classical
languages as Italian and French, entirely eradicated.
About twenty of the Italian dialects have been reduced
to writing, and made known by the press.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> Champollion-Figeac

is carried by some as high as seventy, and
though many of these are hardly more than local varieties,
yet some, like the Tzaconic, differ from the literary
language as much as Doric differed from Attic.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In the island of Lesbos, villages distant from each other
not more than two or three hours have frequently peculiar
words of their own, and their own peculiar pronunciation.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>
But let us take a language which, though not
without a literature, has been less under the influence
of classical writers than Italian or French, and we shall
then see at once how abundant the growth of dialects!
The Friesian, which is spoken on a small area on the
north-western coast of Germany, between the Scheldt
and Jutland, and on the islands near the shore, which
has been spoken there for at least two thousand years,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
and which possesses literary documents as old as the
twelfth century, is broken up into endless local dialects.
I quote from Kohl's Travels. <span class="tei tei-q">“The commonest
things,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“which are named almost alike
all over Europe, receive quite different names in the
different Friesian Islands. Thus, in Amrum, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">father</span></em> is
called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aatj</span></em>; on the Halligs, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">baba</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">babe</span></em>; in Sylt, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foder</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vaar</span></em>; in many districts on the main-land, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">täte</span></em>; in
the eastern part of Föhr, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oti</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ohitj</span></em>. Although these
people live within a couple of German miles from each
other, these words differ more than the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">padre</span></em>
and the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">father</span></em>. Even the names of their districts
and islands are totally different in different dialects.
The island of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sylt</span></em> is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Söl</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sol</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sal</span></em>.”</span>
Each of these dialects, though it might be made out by
a Friesian scholar, is unintelligible except to the peasants
of each narrow district in which it prevails. What
is therefore generally called the Friesian language, and
described as such in Friesian grammars, is in reality
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but one out of many dialects, though, no doubt, the
most important; and the same holds good with regard
to all so-called literary languages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a mistake to imagine that dialects are everywhere
corruptions of the literary language. Even in
England,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> the local patois have many forms which are
more primitive than the language of Shakespeare, and
the richness of their vocabulary surpasses, on many
points, that of the classical writers of any period.
Dialects have always been the feeders rather than
the channels of a literary language; anyhow, they
are parallel streams which existed long before one
of them was raised to that temporary eminence which
is the result of literary cultivation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What Grimm says of the origin of dialects in general
applies only to such as are produced by phonetic corruption.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Dialects,”</span> he writes,<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“develop themselves
progressively, and the more we look backward in the
history of language the smaller is their number, and the
less definite their features. All multiplicity arises gradually
from an original unity.”</span> So it seems, indeed,
if we build our theories of language exclusively on the
materials supplied by literary idioms, such as Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, and Gothic. No doubt these are the
royal heads in the history of language. But as political
history ought to be more than a chronicle of royal
dynasties, so the historian of language ought never to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lose sight of those lower and popular strata of speech
from which these dynasties originally sprang, and by
which alone they are supported.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, however, lies the difficulty. How are we to
trace the history of dialects? In the ancient history
of language, literary dialects alone supply us with materials,
whereas the very existence of spoken dialects is
hardly noticed by ancient writers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are told, indeed, by Pliny,<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> that in Colchis there
were more than three hundred tribes speaking different
dialects; and that the Romans, in order to carry on
any intercourse with the natives, had to employ a
hundred and thirty interpreters. This is probably an
exaggeration; but we have no reason to doubt the
statement of Strabo,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> who speaks of seventy tribes living
together in that country, which, even now, is
called <span class="tei tei-q">“the mountain of languages.”</span> In modern times,
again, when missionaries have devoted themselves to
the study of the languages of savage and illiterate
tribes, they have seldom been able to do more than to
acquire one out of many dialects; and, when their exertions
have been at all successful, that dialect which
they had reduced to writing, and made the medium of
their civilizing influence, soon assumed a kind of literary
supremacy, so as to leave the rest behind as barbarous
jargons. Yet, whatever is known of the dialects
of savage tribes is chiefly or entirely due to missionaries;
and it is much to be desired that their attention
should again and again be directed to this interesting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
problem of the dialectical life of language which they
alone have the means of elucidating. Gabriel Sagard,
who was sent as a missionary to the Hurons in 1626,
and published his <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Voyage du pays des Hurons,”</span>
at Paris, in 1631, states that among these North
American tribes hardly one village speaks the same
language as another; nay, that two families of the
same village do not speak exactly the same language.
And he adds what is important, that their language
is changing every day, and is already so much changed
that the ancient Huron language is almost entirely different
from the present. During the last two hundred
years, on the contrary, the languages of the Hurons
and Iroquois are said not to have changed at
all.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> We
read of missionaries<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> in Central America who attempted
to write down the language of savage tribes, and who
compiled with great care a dictionary of all the words
they could lay hold of. Returning to the same tribe
after the lapse of only ten years, they found that this
dictionary had become antiquated and useless. Old
words had sunk to the ground, and new ones had risen
to the surface; and to all outward appearance the
language was completely changed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing surprised the Jesuit missionaries so much
as the immense number of languages spoken by the
natives of America. But this, far from being a proof
of a high state of civilization, rather showed that the
various races of America had never submitted, for any
length of time, to a powerful political concentration,
and that they had never succeeded in founding great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
national empires. Hervas reduces, indeed, all the
dialects of America to eleven families<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>—four for
the south, and seven for the north; but this could
be done only by the same careful and minute comparison
which enables us to class the idioms spoken
in Iceland and Ceylon as cognate dialects. For practical
purposes the dialects of America are distinct
dialects, and the people who speak them are mutually
unintelligible.

We hear the same observations everywhere where
the rank growth of dialects has been watched by intelligent
observers. If we turn our eyes to Burmah, we
find that there the Burmese has produced a considerable
literature, and is the recognized medium of communication
not only in Burmah, but likewise in Pegu
and Arakan. But the intricate mountain ranges of the
peninsula of the Irawaddy<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> afford a safe refuge to many
independent tribes, speaking their own independent dialects;
and in the neighborhood of Manipura alone
Captain Gordon collected no less than twelve dialects.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Some of them,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“are spoken by no more
than thirty or forty families, yet so different from the
rest as to be unintelligible to the nearest neighborhood.”</span>
Brown, the excellent American missionary,
who has spent his whole life in preaching the Gospel
in that part of the world, tells us that some tribes who
left their native village to settle in another valley, became
unintelligible to their forefathers in two or three
generations.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>

One more observation of the same character from
the pen of Robert Moffat, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Missionary Scenes
and Labors in Southern Africa.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The purity and
harmony of language,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“is kept up by their
pitches, or public meetings, by their festivals and ceremonies,
as well as by their songs and their constant
intercourse. With the isolated villagers of the desert
it is far otherwise; they have no such meetings; they
are compelled to traverse the wilds, often to a great
distance from their native village. On such occasions
fathers and mothers, and all who can bear a burden,
often set out for weeks at a time, and leave their children
to the care of two or three infirm old people.
The infant progeny, some of whom are beginning to
lisp, while others can just master a whole sentence, and
those still further advanced, romping and playing together,
the children of nature, through their livelong
day, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">become habituated to a language of their own</span></em>. The

host of mongrel words and phrases, joined together
without rule, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the course of one generation the entire

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the life of language in a state of nature; and
in a similar manner, we have a right to conclude, languages
grew up which we only know after the bit and
bridle of literature were thrown over their necks. It
need not be a written or classical literature to give an
ascendency to one out of many dialects, and to impart
to its peculiarities an undisputed legitimacy. Speeches
at pitches or public meetings, popular ballads, national
laws, religious oracles, exercise, though to a smaller
extent, the same influence. They will arrest the natural
flow of language in the countless rivulets of its
dialects, and give a permanency to certain formations
of speech which, without these external influences,
could have enjoyed but an ephemeral existence.
Though we cannot fully enter, at present, on the problem
of the origin of language, yet this we can clearly
see, that, whatever the origin of language was, its first
tendency must have been towards an unbounded variety.
To this there was, however, a natural check,
which prepared from the very beginning the growth
of national and literary languages. The language of
the father became the language of a family; the language
of a family that of a clan. In one and the
same clan different families would preserve among
themselves their own familiar forms and expressions.
They would add new words, some so fanciful and
quaint as to be hardly intelligible to other members of
the same clan. Such expressions would naturally be
suppressed, as we suppress provincial peculiarities and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pet words of our own, at large assemblies where all
clansmen meet and are expected to take part in general
discussions. But they would be cherished all the more
round the fire of each tent, in proportion as the general
dialect of the clan assumed a more formal character.
Class dialects, too, would spring up; the dialects of
servants, grooms, shepherds, and soldiers. Women
would have their own household words; and the rising
generation would not be long without a more racy
phraseology of their own. Even we, in this literary
age, and at a distance of thousands of years from those
early fathers of language, do not speak at home as we
speak in public. The same circumstances which give
rise to the formal language of a clan, as distinguished
from the dialects of families, produce, on a larger scale,
the languages of a confederation of clans, of nascent
colonies, of rising nationalities. Before there is a national
language, there have always been hundreds of
dialects in districts, towns, villages, clans, and families;
and though the progress of civilization and centralization
tends to reduce their number and to soften their
features, it has not as yet annihilated them, even in
our own time.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now look again at what is commonly called
the history, but what ought to be called, the natural
growth, of language, and we shall easily see that it
consists chiefly in the play of the two principles which
we have just examined, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phonetic decay</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dialectical
regeneration</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">growth</span></em>. Let us take the six Romance
languages. It is usual to call these the daughters of
Latin. I do not object to the names of parent and
daughter as applied to languages; only we must not
allow such apparently clear and simple terms to cover
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obscure and vague conceptions. Now if we call Italian
the daughter of Latin, we do not mean to ascribe
to Italian a new vital principle. Not a single radical
element was newly created for the formation of Italian.
Italian is Latin in a new form. Italian is modern
Latin, or Latin ancient Italian. The names <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">daughter</span></em> only mark different periods in the growth
of a language substantially the same. To speak of
Latin dying in giving birth to her offspring is again
pure mythology, and it would be easy to prove that
Latin was a living language long after Italian had
learnt to run alone. Only let us clearly see what
we mean by Latin. The classical Latin is one out of
many dialects spoken by the Aryan inhabitants of
Italy. It was the dialect of Latium, in Latium the
dialect of Rome, at Rome the dialect of the patricians.
It was fixed by Livius Andronicus, Ennius, Nævius,
Cato, and Lucretius, polished by the Scipios, Hortensius,
and Cicero. It was the language of a restricted
class, of a political party, of a literary set. Before
their time, the language of Rome must have changed
and fluctuated considerably. Polybius tells us (iii.
22), that the best-informed Romans could not make
out without difficulty the language of the ancient
treaties between Rome and Carthage. Horace admits
(Ep. ii. 1, 86), that he could not understand the
old Salian poems, and he hints that no one else could.
Quintilian (i. 6, 40) says that the Salian priests could
hardly understand their sacred hymns. If the plebeians
had obtained the upperhand over the patricians,
Latin would have been very different from what it is
in Cicero, and we know that even Cicero, having been
brought up at Arpinum, had to give up some of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
provincial peculiarities, such as the dropping of the
final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, when he began to mix in fashionable society,
and had to write for his new patrician friends.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> After
having been established as the language of legislation,
religion, literature, and general civilization, the classical
Latin dialect became stationary and stagnant. It
could not grow, because it was not allowed to change
or to deviate from its classical correctness. It was
haunted by its own ghost. Literary dialects, or what
are commonly called classical languages, pay for their
temporary greatness by inevitable decay. They are
like stagnant lakes at the side of great rivers. They
form reservoirs of what was once living and running
speech, but they are no longer carried on by the main
current. At times it may seem as if the whole stream
of language was absorbed by these lakes, and we can
hardly trace the small rivulets which run on in the
main bed. But if lower down, that is to say, later in
history, we meet again with a new body of stationary
language, forming or formed, we may be sure that its
tributaries were those very rivulets which for a time
were almost lost from our sight. Or it may be more
accurate to compare a classical or literary idiom with
the frozen surface of a river, brilliant and smooth, but
stiff and cold. It is mostly by political commotions
that this surface of the more polite and cultivated
speech is broken and carried away by the waters rising
underneath. It is during times when the higher classes
are either crushed in religious and social struggles, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mix again with the lower classes to repel foreign invasion;
when literary occupations are discouraged, palaces
burnt, monasteries pillaged, and seats of learning
destroyed,—it is then that the popular, or, as they are
called, the vulgar dialects, which had formed a kind
of undercurrent, rise beneath the crystal surface of
the literary language, and sweep away, like the waters
in spring, the cumbrous formations of a by-gone age.
In more peaceful times, a new and popular literature
springs up in a language which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seems</span></em> to have been
formed by conquests or revolutions, but which, in
reality, had been growing up long before, and was
only brought out, ready made, by historical events.
From this point of view we can see that no literary
language can ever be said to have been the mother of
another language. As soon as a language loses its
unbounded capability of change, its carelessness about
what it throws away, and its readiness in always supplying
instantaneously the wants of mind and heart, its
natural life is changed into a merely artificial existence.
It may still live on for a long time, but while it seems
to be the leading shoot, it is in reality but a broken and
withering branch, slowly falling from the stock from
which it sprang. The sources of Italian are not to be
found in the classical literature of Rome, but in the
popular dialects of Italy. English did not spring from
the Anglo-Saxon of Wessex only, but from the dialects
spoken in every part of Great Britain, distinguished
by local peculiarities, and modified at different
times by the influence of Latin, Danish, Norman,
French, and other foreign elements. Some of the
local dialects of English, as spoken at the present day,
are of great importance for a critical study of English,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a French prince, now living in this country, deserves
great credit for collecting what can still be saved
of English dialects. Hindustani is not the daughter
of Sanskrit, as we find it in the Vedas, or in the later
literature of the Brahmans: it is a branch of the living
speech of India, springing from the same stem
from which Sanskrit sprang, when it first assumed its
literary independence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While thus endeavoring to place the character of
dialects, as the feeders of language, in a clear light, I
may appear to some of my hearers to have exaggerated
their importance. No doubt, if my object had been
different, I might easily have shown that, without
literary cultivation, language would never have acquired
that settled character which is essential for the communication
of thought; that it would never have fulfilled
its highest purpose, but have remained the mere jargon
of shy troglodytes. But as the importance of literary
languages is not likely to be overlooked, whereas the
importance of dialects, as far as they sustain the growth
of language, had never been pointed out, I thought it
better to dwell on the advantages which literary languages
derive from dialects, rather than on the benefits
which dialects owe to literary languages. Besides, our
chief object to-day was to explain the growth of language,
and for that purpose it is impossible to exaggerate
the importance of the constant undergrowth of
dialects. Remove a language from its native soil, tear
it away from the dialects which are its feeders, and you
arrest at once its natural growth. There will still be
the progress of phonetic corruption, but no longer the
restoring influence of dialectic regeneration. The
language which the Norwegian refugees brought to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Iceland has remained almost the same for seven centuries,
whereas on its native soil, and surrounded by
local dialects, it has grown into two distinct languages,
the Swedish and Danish. In the eleventh century,
the languages of Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland are
supposed<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
to have been identical, nor can we appeal
to foreign conquest, or to the admixture of foreign with
native blood, in order to account for the changes which
the language underwent in Sweden and Denmark, but
not in Iceland.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>

We can hardly form an idea of the unbounded resources
of dialects. When literary languages have
stereotyped one general term, their dialects will supply
fifty, though each with its own special shade of meaning.
If new combinations of thought are evolved in
the progress of society, dialects will readily supply the
required names from the store of their so-called superfluous
words. There are not only local and provincial,
but also class dialects. There is a dialect of shepherds,
of sportsmen, of soldiers, of farmers. I suppose there
are few persons here present who could tell the exact
meaning of a horse's poll, crest, withers, dock, hamstring,
cannon, pastern, coronet, arm, jowl, and muzzle.
Where the literary language speaks of the young
of all sorts of animals, farmers, shepherds, and sportsmen
would be ashamed to use so general a term.

their cattle. In a more highly cultivated language
these expressions become burthensome and superfluous.
But, in a peasant's mouth, the bearing, calving, falling,
and killing of almost every animal has its own peculiar
term, as the sportsman delights in calling the gait and
members of game by different names. The eye of
these shepherds, who live in the free air, sees further,
their ear hears more sharply,—why should their speech
not have gained that living truth and variety?”</span>

What, however, I wanted particularly to point out

produce the growth, or, according to others, constitute
the history of language, is under the control of man.
The phonetic decay of language is not the result of
mere accident; it is governed by definite laws, as we
shall see when we come to consider the principles of
comparative grammar. But these laws were not made
by man; on the contrary, man had to obey them without
knowing of their existence.

In the growth of the modern Romance languages
out of Latin, we can perceive not only a general tendency
to simplification, not only a natural disposition
to avoid the exertion which the pronunciation of certain
consonants, and still more, of groups of consonants,
entails on the speaker: but we can see distinct
laws for each of the Romance dialects, which enable
us to say, that in French the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">patrem</span></em> would
naturally grow into the modern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">père</span></em>. The final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></em>
is always dropped in the Romance dialects, and it was
dropped even in Latin. Thus we get <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">patre</span></em> instead of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">patrem</span></em>. Now, a Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></em> between two vowels in such
words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater</span></em> is invariably suppressed in French.
This is a law, and by means of it we can discover at
once that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">catena</span></em> must become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chaine</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fata</span></em>, a later feminine
representation of the old neuter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fatum</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fée</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pratum</span></em>
a meadow, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pré</span></em>. From <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pratum</span></em> we derive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prataria</span></em>,
which in French becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prairie</span></em>; from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fatum</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fataria</span></em>,
the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fairy</span></em>. Thus every Latin participle in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atus</span></em>, like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amatus</span></em>, loved, must end in French in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">é</span></em>.
The same law then changed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">patre</span></em>(pronounced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pa-tere</span></em>)
into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paere</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">père</span></em>; it changed
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matrem</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mère</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fratrem</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frère</span></em>. These changes take place gradually
but irresistibly, and, what is most important, they
are completely beyond the reach or control of the free
will of man.

Dialectical growth again is still more beyond the control
of individuals. For although a poet may knowingly
and intentionally invent a new word, its acceptance
depends on circumstances which defy individual
interference. There are some changes in the
grammar which at first sight might seem to be mainly
attributable to the caprice of the speaker. Granted,
for instance, that the loss of the Latin terminations
was the natural result of a more careless pronunciation;
granted that the modern sign of the French
genitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">du</span></em> is a natural corruption of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de
illo</span></em>,—yet the choice of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de</span></em>, instead of any other word,
to express the genitive, the choice of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">illo</span></em>, instead of
any other pronoun, to express the article, might seem
to prove that man acted as a free agent in the formation
of language. But it is not so. No single individual
could deliberately have set to work in order
to abolish the old Latin genitive, and to replace it by
the periphrastic compound <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de illo</span></em>. It was necessary
that the inconvenience of having no distinct or distinguishable
sign of the genitive should have been felt by
the people who spoke a vulgar Latin dialect. It was
necessary that the same people should have used the
preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de</span></em> in such a manner as to lose sight of its
original local meaning altogether (for instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">una de
multis</span></em>, in Horace, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, one out of many). It was
necessary, again, that the same people should have
felt the want of an article, and should have used <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">illo</span></em>
in numerous expressions, where it seemed to have
lost its original pronominal power. It was necessary
that all these conditions should be given, before
one individual and after him another, and after
him hundreds and thousands and millions, could use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de illo</span></em> as the exponent of the genitive; and change
it into the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dello</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">del</span></em>, and the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">du</span></em>.

The attempts of single grammarians and purists to
improve language are perfectly bootless; and we shall
probably hear no more of schemes to prune languages

say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I gaed</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I coomd</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I catched</span></em>; and it is this sense of grammatical justice,
this generous feeling of what ought to be, which in
the course of centuries has eliminated many so-called
irregular forms. Thus the auxiliary verb in Latin was
very irregular. If <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sumus</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we are</span></em>, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sunt</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they are</span></em>,
the second person, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you are</span></em>, ought to have been, at least
according to the strict logic of children, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sutis</span></em>. This,
no doubt, sounds very barbarous to a classical ear accustomed
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">estis</span></em>. And we see how French, for instance,
has strictly preserved the Latin forms in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nous
sommes</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vous êtes</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ils sont</span></em>. But in Spanish we find
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">somos</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sois</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">son</span></em>;
and this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sois</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sutis</span></em>. We
find similar traces of grammatical levelling in the
Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">siamo</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">siete</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sono</span></em>,
formed in analogy of regular verbs such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crediamo</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credete</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credono</span></em>. The second
person, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sei</span></em>, instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">es</span></em>, is likewise infantine grammar.
So are the Wallachian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">súntemu</span></em>, we are, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">súnteti</span></em>, you are,
which owe their origin to the third person plural <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">súnt</span></em>,
they are. And what shall we say of such monsters as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essendo</span></em>, a gerund derived on principles of strict justice
from an infinitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essere</span></em>, like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credendo</span></em>
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credere</span></em>!

These various influences and conditions under which
language grows and changes, are like the waves and
winds which carry deposits to the bottom of the sea,
where they accumulate, and rise, and grow, and at last
appear on the surface of the earth as a stratum, perfectly
intelligible in all its component parts, not produced
by an inward principle of growth, nor regulated
by invariable laws of nature; yet, on the other hand,
by no means the result of mere accident, or the production
of lawless and uncontrolled agencies. We
cannot be careful enough in the use of our words.
Strictly speaking, neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">history</span></em> nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">growth</span></em> is applicable
to the changes of the shifting surface of the earth.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">History</span></em> applies to the actions of free agents; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">growth</span></em> to
the natural unfolding of organic beings. We speak,
however, of the growth of the crust of the earth, and
we know what we mean by it; and it is in this sense,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but not in the sense of growth as applied to a tree, that
we have a right to speak of the growth of language.
If that modification which takes place in time by continually
new combinations of given elements, which
withdraws itself from the control of free agents, and
can in the end be recognized as the result of natural
agencies, may be called growth; and if so defined, we
may apply it to the growth of the crust of the earth;
the same word, in the same sense, will be applicable to
language, and will justify us in removing the science
of language from the pale of the historical to that of
the physical sciences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another objection which we have to consider,
and the consideration of which will again help
us to understand more clearly the real character of
language. The great periods in the growth of the
earth which have been established by geological research
are brought to their close, or very nearly so,
when we discover the first vestiges of human life, and
when the history of man, in the widest sense of the
word, begins. The periods in the growth of language,
on the contrary, begin and run parallel with the history
of man. It has been said, therefore, that although
language may not be merely a work of art, it would,
nevertheless, be impossible to understand the life and
growth of any language without an historical knowledge
of the times in which that language grew up.
We ought to know, it is said, whether a language
which is to be analyzed under the microscope of comparative
grammar, has been growing up wild, among
wild tribes, without a literature, oral or written, in
poetry or in prose; or whether it has received the cultivation
of poets, priests, and orators, and retained the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
impress of a classical age. Again, it is only from the
annals of political history that we can learn whether
one language has come in contact with another, how
long this contact has lasted, which of the two nations
stood higher in civilization, which was the conquering
and which the conquered, which of the two established
the laws, the religion, and the arts of the country,
and which produced the greatest number of national
teachers, popular poets, and successful demagogues.
All these questions are of a purely historical character,
and the science which has to borrow so much from
historical sources, might well be considered an anomaly
in the sphere of the physical sciences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in answer to this, it cannot be denied that
among the physical sciences none is so intimately connected
with the history of man as the science of language.
But a similar connection, though in a less
degree, can be shown to exist between other branches
of physical research and the history of man. In
zoölogy, for instance, it is of some importance to know
at what particular period of history, in what country,
and for what purposes certain animals were tamed and
domesticated. In ethnology, a science, we may remark
in passing, quite distinct from the science of
language, it would be difficult to account for the Caucasian
stamp impressed on the Mongolian race in
Hungary, or on the Tatar race in Turkey, unless we
knew from written documents the migrations and settlements
of the Mongolic and Tataric tribes in Europe.
A botanist, again, comparing several specimens of rye,
would find it difficult to account for their respective
peculiarities, unless he knew that in some parts of the
world this plant has been cultivated for centuries,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whereas in other regions, as, for instance, in Mount
Caucasus, it is still allowed to grow wild. Plants
have their own countries, like races, and the presence
of the cucumber in Greece, the orange and cherry in
Italy, the potatoe in England, and the vine at the Cape,
can be fully explained by the historian only. The
more intimate relation, therefore, between the history
of language and the history of man is not sufficient to
exclude the science of language from the circle of the
physical sciences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nay, it might be shown, that, if strictly defined, the
science of language can declare itself completely independent
of history. If we speak of the language of
England, we ought, no doubt, to know something of
the political history of the British Isles, in order to
understand the present state of that language. Its history
begins with the early Britons, who spoke a Celtic
dialect; it carries us on to the Saxon conquest, to the
Danish invasions, to the Norman conquest: and we
see how each of these political events contributed to
the formation of the character of the language. The
language of England may be said to have been in succession
Celtic, Saxon, Norman, and English. But if
we speak of the history of the English language, we
enter on totally different ground. The English language
was never Celtic, the Celtic never grew into
Saxon, nor the Saxon into Norman, nor the Norman
into English. The history of the Celtic language runs
on to the present day. It matters not whether it be
spoken by all the inhabitants of the British Isles, or
only by a small minority in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.
A language, as long as it is spoken by anybody,
lives and has its substantive existence. The last
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
old woman that spoke Cornish, and to whose memory
it is now intended to raise a monument, represented by
herself alone the ancient language of Cornwall. A
Celt may become an Englishman, Celtic and English
blood may be mixed; and who could tell at the present
day the exact proportion of Celtic and Saxon
blood in the population of England? But languages
are never mixed. It is indifferent by what name
the language spoken in the British Islands be called,
whether English or British or Saxon; to the student
of language English is Teutonic, and nothing but
Teutonic. The physiologist may protest, and point
out that in many instances the skull, or the bodily
habitat of the English language, is of a Celtic type;
the genealogist may protest and prove that the arms
of many an English family are of Norman origin; the
student of language must follow his own way. Historical
information as to an early substratum of Celtic
inhabitants in Britain, as to Saxon, Danish, and Norman
invasions may be useful to him. But though
every record were burned, and every skull mouldered,
the English language, as spoken by any ploughboy,
would reveal its own history, if analyzed according to
the rules of comparative grammar. Without the help
of history, we should see that English is Teutonic,
that like Dutch and Friesian it belongs to the Low-German
branch; that this branch, together with the
High-German, Gothic, and Scandinavian branches,
constitute the Teutonic class; that this Teutonic class,
together with the Celtic, Slavonic, the Hellenic, Italic,
Iranic, and Indic classes constitute the great Indo-European
or Aryan family of speech. In the English
dictionary the student of the science of language
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can detect, by his own tests, Celtic, Norman, Greek,
and Latin ingredients, but not a single drop of foreign
blood has entered into the organic system of the English
language. The grammar, the blood and soul of
the language, is as pure and unmixed in English as
spoken in the British Isles, as it was when spoken on
the shores of the German Ocean by the Angles, Saxons,
and Juts of the continent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In thus considering and refuting the objections which
have been, or might be, made against the admission of
the science of language into the circle of the physical
sciences, we have arrived at some results which it may
be useful to recapitulate before we proceed further.
We saw that whereas philology treats language only as
a means, comparative philology chooses language as the
object of scientific inquiry. It is not the study of one
language, but of many, and in the end of all, which
forms the aim of this new science. Nor is the language
of Homer of greater interest, in the scientific
treatment of human speech, than the dialect of the
Hottentots.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We saw, secondly, that after the first practical acquisition
and careful analysis of the facts and forms of
any language, the next and most important step is the
classification of all the varieties of human speech, and
that only after this has been accomplished would it be
safe to venture on the great questions which underlie
all physical research, the questions as to the what, the
whence, and the why of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We saw, thirdly, that there is a distinction between
what is called history and growth. We determined the
true meaning of growth, as applied to language, and
perceived how it was independent of the caprice of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man, and governed by laws that could be discovered
by careful observation, and be traced back in the end
to higher laws, which govern the organs both of human
thought, and of the human voice. Though admitting
that the science of language was more intimately connected
than any other physical science with what is
called the political history of man, we found that,
strictly speaking, our science might well dispense with
this auxiliary, and that languages can be analyzed and
classified on their own evidence particularly on the
strength of their grammatical articulation, without
any reference to the individuals, families, clans, tribes,
nations, or races by whom they are or have been
spoken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the course of these considerations, we had to lay
down two axioms, to which we shall frequently have to
appeal in the progress of our investigations. The first
declares grammar to be the most essential element, and
therefore the ground of classification in all languages
which have produced a definite grammatical articulation;
the second denies the possibility of a mixed
language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These two axioms are, in reality, but one, as we
shall see when we examine them more closely.
There is hardly a language which in one sense may
not be called a mixed language. No nation or tribe
was ever so completely isolated as not to admit the
importation of a certain number of foreign words.
In some instances these imported words have changed
the whole native aspect of the language, and have
even acquired a majority over the native element.
Turkish is a Turanian dialect; its grammar is purely
Tataric or Turanian. The Turks, however, possessed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but a small literature and narrow civilization
before they were converted to Mohammedanism. Now,
the language of Mohammed was Arabic, a branch of
the Semitic family, closely allied to Hebrew and Syriac.
Together with the Koran, and their law and religion,
the Turks learned from the Arabs, their conquerors,
many of the arts and sciences connected with a more
advanced stage of civilization. Arabic became to the
Turks what Latin was to the Germans during the
Middle Ages; and there is hardly a word in the higher
intellectual terminology of Arabic, that might not be
used, more or less naturally, by a writer in Turkish.
But the Arabs, again, at the very outset of their career
of conquest and conversion, had been, in science, art,
literature, and polite manners, the pupils of the Persians,
whom they had conquered; they stood to them in
the same relation as the Romans stood to the Greeks.
Now, the Persians speak a language which is neither
Semitic, like Arabic, nor Turanian, like Turkish; it is
a branch of the Indo-European or Aryan family of
speech. A large infusion of Persian words thus found
its way into Arabic, and through Arabic into Turkish;
and the result is that at the present moment the Turkish
language, as spoken by the higher ranks at Constantinople,
is so entirely overgrown with Persian and Arabic
words, that a common clod from the country understands
but little of the so-called Osmanli, though its
grammar is exactly the same as the grammar which he
uses in his Tataric utterance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, perhaps, no language so full of words evidently
derived from the most distant sources as English.
Every country of the globe seems to have brought some
of its verbal manufactures to the intellectual market of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
England. Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Celtic, Saxon, Danish,
French, Spanish, Italian, German—nay, even Hindustani,
Malay, and Chinese words, lie mixed together
in the English dictionary. On the evidence of words
alone it would be impossible to classify English with
any other of the established stocks and stems of human
speech. Leaving out of consideration the smaller ingredients,
we find, on comparing the Teutonic with
the Latin, or Neo-Latin or Norman elements in English,
that the latter have a decided majority over the
home-grown Saxon terms. This may seem incredible;
and if we simply took a page of any English book, and
counted therein the words of purely Saxon and Latin
origin, the majority would be no doubt on the Saxon
side. The articles, pronouns, prepositions, and auxiliary
verbs, all of which are of Saxon growth, occur
over and over again in one and the same page. Thus,
Hickes maintained that nine tenths of the English dictionary
were Saxon, because there were only three
words of Latin origin in the Lord's prayer. Sharon
Turner, who extended his observations over a larger
field, came to the conclusion that the relation of Norman
to Saxon was as four to six. Another writer,
who estimates the whole number of English words at
38,000, assigns 23,000 to a Saxon, and 15,000 to a
classical source. On taking, however, a more accurate
inventory, and counting every word in the dictionaries
of Robertson and Webster, M. Thommerel
has established the fact that of the sum total of 43,566
words, 29,853 came from classical, 13,230 from Teutonic,
and the rest from miscellaneous sources.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> On the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evidence of its dictionary, therefore, and treating English
as a mixed language, it would have to be classified
together with French, Italian, and Spanish, as one of
the Romance or Neo-Latin dialects. Languages, however,
though mixed in their dictionary, can never be
mixed in their grammar. Hervas was told by missionaries
that in the middle of the eighteenth century the
Araucans used hardly a single word which was not Spanish,
though they preserved both the grammar and the
syntax of their own native speech.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>
This is the reason
why grammar is made the criterion of the relationship
and the base of the classification in almost all languages;
and it follows, therefore, as a matter of course,
that in the classification and in the science of language,
it is impossible to admit the existence of a mixed idiom.
We may form whole sentences in English consisting entirely
of Latin or Romance words; yet whatever there
is left of grammar in English bears unmistakable traces
of Teutonic workmanship. What may now be called
grammar in English is little more than the terminations
of the genitive singular, and nominative plural
of nouns, the degrees of comparison, and a few of the
persons and tenses of the verb. Yet the single <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, used
as the exponent of the third person singular of the indicative
present, is irrefragable evidence that in a scientific
classification of languages, English, though it did
not retain a single word of Saxon origin, would have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be classed as Saxon, and as a branch of the great
Teutonic stem of the Aryan family of speech. In ancient
and less matured languages, grammar, or the
formal part of human speech, is far more abundantly
developed than in English; and it is, therefore, a much
safer guide for discovering a family likeness in scattered
members of the same family. There are languages in
which there is no trace of what we are accustomed to
call grammar; for instance, ancient Chinese; there are
others in which we can still watch the growth of grammar,
or, more correctly, the gradual lapse of material
into merely formal elements. In these languages new
principles of classification will have to be applied, such
as are suggested by the study of natural history; and
we shall have to be satisfied with the criteria of a morphological
affinity, instead of those of a genealogical
relationship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have thus answered, I hope, some of the objections
which threatened to deprive the science of language of
that place which she claims in the circle of the physical
sciences. We shall see in our next lecture what the
history of our science has been from its beginning to
the present day, and how far it may be said to have
passed through the three stages, the empirical, the classificatory,
and the theoretical, which mark the childhood,
the youth, and the manhood of every one of the
natural sciences.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We begin to-day to trace the historical progress of
the science of language in its three stages, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Empirical</span></em>,
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Classificatory</span></em>, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theoretical</span></em>. As a general
rule each physical science begins with analysis, proceeds
to classification, and ends with theory; but, as I
pointed out in my first lecture, there are frequent exceptions
to this rule, and it is by no means uncommon to find
that philosophical speculations, which properly belong
to the last or theoretical stage, were attempted in physical
sciences long before the necessary evidence had
been collected or arranged. Thus, we find that the
science of language, in the only two countries where
we can watch its origin and history—in India and
Greece—rushes at once into theories about the mysterious
nature of speech, and cares as little for facts
as the man who wrote an account of the camel without
ever having seen the animal or the desert. The
Brahmans, in the hymns of the Veda, raised language
to the rank of a deity, as they did with all things of
which they knew not what they were. They addressed
hymns to her in which she is said to have
been with the gods from the beginning, achieving
wondrous things, and never revealed to man except
in part. In the Bráhmaņas, language is called the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cow, breath the bull, and their young is said to be

said to be known through speech, nay, speech herself
is called the Supreme Brahman. At a very early
period, however, the Brahmans recovered from their
raptures about language, and set to work with wonderful
skill dissecting her sacred body. Their achievements
in grammatical analysis, which date from the
sixth century, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, are still unsurpassed in the grammatical
literature of any nation. The idea of reducing
a whole language to a small number of roots,
which in Europe was not attempted before the sixteenth
century by Henry Estienne,<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> was perfectly

the rank of a deity, paid her, nevertheless, the greatest
honors in their ancient schools of philosophy. There
is hardly one of their representative philosophers who
has not left some saying on the nature of language.
The world without, or nature, and the world within,
or mind, did not excite more wonder and elicit deeper
oracles of wisdom from the ancient sages of Greece
than language, the image of both, of nature and of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mind. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is language?”</span> was a question asked
quite as early as <span class="tei tei-q">“What am I?”</span> and, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is all this
world around me?”</span> The problem of language was
in fact a recognized battle-field for the different schools
of ancient Greek philosophy, and we shall have to
glance at their early guesses on the nature of human
speech, when we come to consider the third or theoretical
stage in the science of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At present, we have to look for the early traces of
the first or empirical stage. And here it might seem
doubtful what was the real work to be assigned to
this stage. What can be meant by the empirical treatment
of language? Who were the men that did for
language what the sailor did for his stars, the miner for
his minerals, the gardener for his flowers? Who was
the first to give any thought to language?—to distinguish
between its component parts, between nouns and
verbs, between articles and pronouns, between the nominative
and accusative, the active and passive? Who
invented these terms, and for what purpose were they
invented?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must be careful in answering these questions,
for, as I said before, the merely empirical analysis of
language was preceded in Greece by more general inquiries
into the nature of thought and language; and
the result has been that many of the technical terms
which form the nomenclature of empirical grammar,
existed in the schools of philosophy long before they
were handed over, ready made, to the grammarian.
The distinction of noun and verb, or more correctly,
of subject and predicate, was the work of philosophers.
Even the technical terms of case, of number, and gender,
were coined at a very early time for the purpose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of entering into the nature of thought; not for the
practical purpose of analyzing the forms of language.
This, their practical application to the spoken language
of Greece, was the work of a later generation. It was
the teacher of languages who first compared the categories
of thought with the realities of the Greek language.
It was he who transferred the terminology of
Aristotle and the Stoics from thought to speech, from
logic to grammar; and thus opened the first roads
into the impervious wilderness of spoken speech. In
doing this, the grammarian had to alter the strict acceptation
of many of the terms which he borrowed
from the philosopher, and he had to coin others before
he could lay hold of all the facts of language even in the
roughest manner. For, indeed, the distinction between
noun and verb, between active and passive, between
nominative and accusative, does not help us much towards
a scientific analysis of language. It is no more
than a first grasp, and it can only be compared with
the most elementary terminology in other branches of
human knowledge. Nevertheless, it was a beginning,
a very important beginning; and if we preserve in our
histories of the world the names of those who are said
to have discovered the four physical elements, the
names of a Thales and Anaximenes, we ought not
to forget the names of the discoverers of the elements
of language—the founders of one of the most useful
and most successful branches of philosophy—the first
Grammarians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grammar then, in the usual sense of the word, or
the merely formal and empirical analysis of language,
owes its origin, like all other sciences, to a very natural
and practical want. The first practical grammarian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was the first practical teacher of languages, and if
we want to know the beginnings of the science of
language, we must try to find out at what time in
the history of the world, and under what circumstances,
people first thought of learning any language
besides their own. At <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> time we shall find the
first practical grammar, and not till then. Much
may have been ready at hand through the less interested
researches of philosophers, and likewise through
the critical studies of the scholars of Alexandria on
the ancient forms of their language as preserved in
the Homeric poems. But rules of declension and
conjugation, paradigms of regular and irregular nouns
and verbs, observations on syntax, and the like, these
are the work of the teachers of languages, and of no
one else.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the teaching of languages, though at present
so large a profession, is comparatively a very modern
invention. No ancient Greek ever thought of learning
a foreign language. Why should he? He divided the
whole world into Greeks and Barbarians, and he would
have felt himself degraded by adopting either the dress
or the manners or the language of his barbarian neighbors.
He considered it a privilege to speak Greek, and
even dialects closely related to his own, were treated
by him as mere jargons. It takes time before people
conceive the idea that it is possible to express oneself
in any but one's own language. The Poles called
their neighbors, the Germans, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Niemiec</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">niemy</span></em> meaning
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dumb</span></em>;<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> just as the Greeks called the Barbarians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aglossoi</span></em>, or speechless. The name which the Germans
gave to their neighbors, the Celts, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Walh</span></em> in old
High German, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vealh</span></em> in Anglo-Saxon, the modern
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Welsh</span></em>, is supposed to be the same as the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mlechha</span></em>, and means a person who talks
indistinctly.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even when the Greeks began to feel the necessity
of communicating with foreign nations, when they
felt a desire of learning their idioms, the problem was
by no means solved. For how was a foreign language
to be learnt as long as either party could only speak
their own? The problem was almost as difficult as
when, as we are told by some persons, the first men,
as yet speechless, came together in order to invent
speech, and to discuss the most appropriate names
that should be given to the perceptions of the senses
and the abstractions of the mind. At first, it must
be supposed that the Greek learned foreign languages
very much as children learn their own. The interpreters
mentioned by ancient historians were probably
children of parents speaking different languages. The
son of a Scythian and a Greek would naturally learn
the utterances both of his father and mother, and the
lucrative nature of his services would not fail to increase
the supply. We are told, though on rather
mythical authority, that the Greeks were astonished
at the multiplicity of languages which they encountered
during the Argonautic expedition, and that they
were much inconvenienced by the want of skilful
interpreters.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
We need not wonder at this, for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
English army was hardly better off than the army
of Jason; and such is the variety of dialects spoken
in the Caucasian Isthmus, that it is still called by the
inhabitants <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mountain of Languages.”</span> If we turn
our eyes from these mythical ages to the historical times
of Greece, we find that trade gave the first encouragement
to the profession of interpreters. Herodotus tells
us (iv. 24), that caravans of Greek merchants, following
the course of the Volga upwards to the Oural
mountains, were accompanied by seven interpreters,
speaking seven different languages. These must have
comprised Slavonic, Tataric, and Finnic dialects, spoken
in those countries in the time of Herodotus, as they are
at the present day. The wars with Persia first familiarized
the Greeks with the idea that other nations also
possessed real languages. Themistocles studied Persian,
and is said to have spoken it fluently. The expedition
of Alexander contributed still more powerfully
to a knowledge of other nations and languages. But
when Alexander went to converse with the Brahmans,
who were even then considered by the Greeks as the
guardians of a most ancient and mysterious wisdom,
their answers had to be translated by so many interpreters
that one of the Brahmans remarked, they must
become like water that had passed through many impure
channels.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> We hear, indeed, of more ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Greek travellers, and it is difficult to understand how,
in those early times, anybody could have travelled without
a certain knowledge of the language of the people
through whose camps and villages and towns he
had to pass. Many of these travels, however, particularly
those which are said to have extended as
far as India, are mere inventions of later writers.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>
Lycurgus may have travelled to Spain and Africa,
he certainly did not proceed to India, nor is there
any mention of his intercourse with the Indian Gymnosophists
before Aristocrates, who lived about 100 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>
The travels of Pythagoras are equally mythical; they
are inventions of Alexandrian writers, who believed
that all wisdom must have flowed from the East.
There is better authority for believing that Democritus
went to Egypt and Babylon, but his more distant
travels to India are likewise legendary. Herodotus,
though he travelled in Egypt and Persia, never
gives us to understand that he was able to converse
in any but his own language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As far as we can tell, the barbarians seem to have
possessed a greater facility for acquiring languages than
either Greeks or Romans. Soon after the Macedonian
conquest, we find<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Berosus</span></span> in Babylon,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menander</span></span> in Tyre, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manetho</span></span>
in Egypt, compiling, from original sources, the annals of their
countries.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> Their works
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were written in Greek, and for the Greeks. The native
language of Berosus was Babylonian, of Menander
Phenician, of Manetho Egyptian. Berosus was able
to read the cuneiform documents of Babylonia with
the same ease with which Manetho read the papyri of
Egypt. The almost contemporaneous appearance of
three such men, barbarians by birth and language, who
were anxious to save the histories of their countries
from total oblivion, by entrusting them to the keeping
of their conquerors, the Greeks, is highly significant.
But what is likewise significant, and by no means
creditable to the Greek or Macedonian conquerors, is
the small value which they seem to have set on these
works. They have all been lost, and are known to us
by fragments only, though there can be little doubt
that the work of Berosus would have been an invaluable
guide to the student of the cuneiform inscriptions
and of Babylonian history, and that Manetho, if preserved
complete, would have saved us volumes of controversy
on Egyptian chronology. We learn, however,
from the almost simultaneous appearance of these
works, that soon after the epoch marked by Alexander's
conquests in the East, the Greek language was
studied and cultivated by literary men of barbarian
origin, though we should look in vain for any Greek
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
learning or employing any but his own tongue for literary
purposes. We hear of no intellectual intercourse
between Greeks and barbarians before the days of
Alexander and Alexandria. At Alexandria, various
nations, speaking different languages, and believing in
different gods, were brought together. Though primarily
engaged in mercantile speculations, it was but natural
that in their moments of leisure they should hold
discourse on their native countries, their gods, their
kings, their law-givers, and poets. Besides, there were
Greeks at Alexandria who were engaged in the study
of antiquity, and who knew how to ask questions from
men coming from any country of the world. The
pretension of the Egyptians to a fabulous antiquity, the
belief of the Jews in the sacred character of their laws,
the faith of the Persians in the writings of Zoroaster,
all these were fit subjects for discussion in the halls and
libraries of Alexandria. We probably owe the translation
of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, to this
spirit of literary inquiry which was patronized at Alexandria
by the Ptolemies.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> The writings of Zoroaster
also, the Zend-Avesta, would seem to have been rendered
into Greek about the same time. For Hermippus,
who is said by Pliny to have translated the
writings of Zoroaster, was in all probability
Hermippus,<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>
the Peripatetic philosopher, the pupil of Callimachus,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one of the most learned scholars at Alexandria.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although we find at Alexandria these and similar
traces of a general interest having been excited by
the literatures of other nations, there is no evidence
which would lead us to suppose that their languages
also had become the subject of scientific inquiry. It
was not through the study of other languages, but
through the study of the ancient dialects of their own
language, that the Greeks at Alexandria were first led
to what we should call critical and philological studies.
The critical study of Greek took its origin at Alexandria,
and it was chiefly based on the text of Homer.
The general outline of grammar existed, as I remarked
before, at an earlier period. It grew up in the schools
of Greek philosophers.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> Plato knew of noun and
verb as the two component parts of speech. Aristotle
added conjunctions and articles. He likewise observed
the distinctions of number and case. But neither Plato
nor Aristotle paid much attention to the forms of language
which corresponded to these forms of thought,
nor had they any inducement to reduce them to any
practical rules. With Aristotle the verb or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rhēmha</span></em> is
hardly more than predicate, and in sentences such as
<span class="tei tei-q">“the snow is white,”</span> he would have called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white</span></em> a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verb. The first who reduced the actual forms of language
to something like order were the scholars of
Alexandria. Their chief occupation was to publish
correct texts of the Greek classics, and particularly of
Homer. They were forced, therefore, to pay attention
to the exact forms of Greek grammar. The MSS.
sent to Alexandria and Pergamus from different parts
of Greece varied considerably, and it could only be
determined by careful observation which forms were to
be tolerated in Homer and which were not. Their
editions of Homer were not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ekdoseis</span></em>, a Greek
word literally rendered in Latin by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editio</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> issues
of books, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diorthōseis</span></em>, that is to say, critical editions.
There were different schools, opposed to each other in
their views of the language of Homer. Each reading
that was adopted by Zenodotus or Aristarchus had to
be defended, and this could only be done by establishing
general rules on the grammar of the Homeric
poems. Did Homer use the article? Did he use it
before proper names? These and similar questions
had to be settled, and as one or the other view was
adopted by the editors, the text of these ancient poems
was changed by more or less violent emendations. New
technical terms were required for distinguishing, for instance,
the article, if once recognized, from the demonstrative
pronoun. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Article</span></em> is a literal translation of the Greek
word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arthron</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arthron</span></em> (Lat. artus) means the socket
of a joint. The word was first used by Aristotle, and
with him it could only mean words which formed, as it
were, the sockets in which the members of a sentence
moved. In such a sentence as: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever did it, he
shall suffer for it,”</span> Greek grammarians would have
called the demonstrative pronoun <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> the first socket,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the relative pronoun <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>, the second
socket;<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> and
before Zenodotus, the first librarian of Alexandria,
250 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, all pronouns were simply classed as sockets
or articles of speech. He was the first to introduce a
distinction between personal pronouns or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antonymiai</span></em>,
and the mere articles or articulations of speech, which
henceforth retained the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arthra</span></em>. This distinction
was very necessary, and it was, no doubt, suggested
to him by his emendations of the text of Homer,
Zenodotus being the first who restored the article before
proper names in the Iliad and Odyssey. Who,
in speaking now of the definite or indefinite article,
thinks of the origin and original meaning of the word,
and of the time which it took before it could become
what it is now, a technical term familiar to every
school-boy?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, to take another illustration of the influence
which the critical study of Homer at Alexandria exercised
on the development of grammatical terminology,—we
see that the first idea of numbers, of a
singular and a plural, was fixed and defined by the
philosopher. But Aristotle had no such technical
terms as singular and plural; and he does not even allude
to the dual. He only speaks of the cases which
express one or many, though with him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">case</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ptōsis</span></em>, had
a very different meaning from what it has in our grammars.
The terms singular and plural were not invented
till they were wanted, and they were first wanted
by the grammarians. Zenodotus, the editor of Homer,
was the first to observe the use of the dual in the Homeric
poems, and, with the usual zeal of discoverers,
he has altered many a plural into a dual when there
was no necessity for it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scholars of Alexandria, therefore, and of the
rival academy of Pergamus, were the first who studied
the Greek language critically, that is to say, who analyzed
the language, arranged it under general categories,
distinguished the various parts of speech, invented
proper technical terms for the various functions of
words, observed the more or less correct usage of
certain poets, marked the difference between obsolete
and classical forms, and published long and learned
treatises on all these subjects. Their works mark a
great era in the history of the science of language.
But there was still a step to be made before we can
expect to meet with a real practical or elementary
grammar of the Greek language. Now the first real
Greek grammar was that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dionysius Thrax</span></span>. It is
still in existence, and though its genuineness has been
doubted, these doubts have been completely disposed of.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But who was Dionysius Thrax? His father, as we
learn from his name, was a Thracian; but Dionysius
himself lived at Alexandria, and was a pupil of the
famous critic and editor of Homer, Aristarchus.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> Dionysius
afterwards went to Rome, where he taught
about the time of Pompey. Now here we see a new
feature in the history of mankind. A Greek, a pupil
of Aristarchus, settles at Rome, and writes a practical
grammar of the Greek language—of course, for the
benefit of his young Roman pupils. He was not the
inventor of grammatical science. Nearly all the framework
of grammar, as we saw, was supplied to him
through the labors of his predecessors from Plato to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Aristarchus. But he was the first who applied the results
of former philosophers and critics to the practical
purpose of teaching Greek; and, what is most important,
of teaching Greek not to Greeks, who knew
Greek and only wanted the theory of their language,
but to Romans who had to be taught the declensions
and conjugations, regular and irregular. His work
thus became one of the principal channels through
which the grammatical terminology, which had been
carried from Athens to Alexandria, flowed back to
Rome, to spread from thence over the whole civilized
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dionysius, however, though the author of the first
practical grammar, was by no means the first <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">professeur
de langue</span></em>”</span> who settled at Rome. At his
time Greek was more generally spoken at Rome than
French is now spoken in London. The children of
gentlemen learnt Greek before they learnt Latin, and
though Quintilian in his work on education does not
approve of a boy learning nothing but Greek for any
length of time, <span class="tei tei-q">“as is now the fashion,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
most people,”</span> yet he too recommends that a boy should
be taught Greek first, and Latin
afterwards.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> This
may seem strange, but the fact is that as long as we
know anything of Italy, the Greek language was as
much at home there as Latin. Italy owed almost
everything to Greece, not only in later days when the
setting sun of Greek civilization mingled its rays with
the dawn of Roman greatness; but ever since the first
Greek colonists started Westward Ho! in search of
new homes. It was from the Greeks that the Italians
received their alphabet and were taught to read and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

connected with seafaring,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> not excepting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nausea</span></em> or
sea-sickness, are all borrowed from Greek, and show
the extent to which the Italians were indebted to the
Greeks for the very rudiments of civilization. The
Italians, no doubt, had their own national gods, but
they soon became converts to the mythology of the
Greeks. Some of the Greek gods they identified with
their own; others they admitted as new deities. Thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturnus</span></em>, originally an Italian harvest god, was identified
with the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kronos</span></em>, and as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kronos</span></em> was the
son of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uranos</span></em>, a new deity was invented, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturnus</span></em>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Herculus</span></em>, the god of hurdles, enclosures, and walls, was
merged in the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Heracles</span></em>.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Castor</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pollux</span></em>,
both of purely Greek origin, were readily believed in
as nautical deities by the Italian sailors, and they were
the first Greek gods to whom, after the battle on the
Lake Regillus (485), a temple was erected at Rome.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>

whose oracle at Delphi had been consulted by Italians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ever since Greek colonists had settled on their soil.
The oracles of the famous Sibylla of Cumæ were
written in Greek,<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>
and the priests (duoviri sacris

When the Romans, in 454 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, wanted to establish

Before the beginning of the Punic wars,
many of the Roman statesmen were able to understand,
and even to speak Greek. Boys were not
only taught the Roman letters by their masters, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">literatores</span></em>, but they had to learn at the same time
the Greek alphabet. Those who taught Greek at
Rome were then called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grammatici</span></em>, and they were
mostly Greek slaves or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liberti</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the young men whom Cato saw growing
up at Rome, to know Greek was the same as to be a
gentleman. They read Greek books, they conversed
in Greek, they even wrote in Greek. Tiberius Gracchus,
consul in 177, made a speech in Greek at
Rhodes, which he afterwards published.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> Flaminius,
when addressed by the Greeks in Latin, returned the
compliment by writing Greek verses in honor of their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gods. The first history of Rome was written at Rome
in Greek, by Fabius Pictor,<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> about 200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>; and it
was probably in opposition to this work, and to those
of Lucius Cincius Alimentus, and Publius Scipio, that
Cato wrote his own history of Rome in Latin. The
example of the higher classes was eagerly followed by
the lowest. The plays of Plautus are the best proof;
for the affectation of using Greek words is as evident
in some of his characters as the foolish display of
French in the German writers of the eighteenth century.
There was both loss and gain in the inheritance
which Rome received from Greece; but what would
Rome have been without her Greek masters? The
very fathers of Roman literature were Greeks, private
teachers, men who made a living by translating
school-books and plays. Livius Andronicus, sent as
prisoner of war from Tarentum (272 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>), established
himself at Rome as professor of Greek. His
translation of the Odyssey into Latin verse, which
marks the beginning of Roman literature, was evidently
written by him for the use of his private
classes. His style, though clumsy and wooden in the
extreme, was looked upon as a model of perfection by
the rising poets of the capital. Nævius and Plautus
were his cotemporaries and immediate successors.
All the plays of Plautus were translations and adaptations
of Greek originals; and Plautus was not even
allowed to transfer the scene from Greece to Rome.
The Roman public wanted to see Greek life and
Greek depravity; it would have stoned the poet who
had ventured to bring on the stage a Roman patrician
or a Roman matron. Greek tragedies, also, were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
translated into Latin. Ennius, the cotemporary of
Nævius and Plautus, though somewhat younger (239-169),
was the first to translate Euripides. Ennius,
like Andronicus, was an Italian Greek, who settled
at Rome as a teacher of languages and translator of
Greek. He was patronized by the liberal party, by
Publius Scipio, Titus Flaminius, and Marcus Fulvius
Nobilior.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> He became a Roman citizen. But Ennius
was more than a poet, more than a teacher of languages.
He has been called a neologian, and to a
certain extent he deserved that name. Two works
written in the most hostile spirit against the religion
of Greece, and against the very existence of the Greek
gods, were translated by him into Latin.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> One was the philosophy of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epicharmus</span></span> (470 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, in Megara),
who taught that Zeus was nothing but the air, and
other gods but names of the powers of nature; the
other the work of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euhemerus</span></span>,
of Messene (300 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>),
who proved, in the form of a novel, that the Greek
gods had never existed, and that those who were believed
in as gods had been men. These two works
were not translated without a purpose; and though
themselves shallow in the extreme, they proved destructive
to the still shallower systems of Roman
theology. Greek became synonymous with infidel;
and Ennius would hardly have escaped the punishment
inflicted on Nævius for his political satires, had
he not enjoyed the patronage and esteem of the most
influential statesmen at Rome. Even Cato, the stubborn
enemy of Greek philosophy<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> and rhetoric, was a
friend of the dangerous Ennius; and such was the
growing influence of Greek at Rome, that Cato himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had to learn it in his old age, in order to teach his
boy what he considered, if not useful, at least harmless
in Greek literature. It has been the custom to laugh
at Cato for his dogged opposition to everything Greek;
but there was much truth in his denunciations. We
have heard much of young Bengál—young Hindus
who read Byron and Voltaire, play at billiards, drive
tandems, laugh at their priests, patronize missionaries,
and believe nothing. The description which Cato
gives of the young idlers at Rome reminds us very
much of young Bengál.

When Rome took the torch of knowledge from the
dying hands of Greece, that torch was not burning
with its brightest light. Plato and Aristotle had been
succeeded by Chrysippus and Carneades; Euripides
and Menander had taken the place of Æschylus and
Sophocles. In becoming the guardian of the Promethean
spark first lighted in Greece, and intended hereafter
to illuminate not only Italy, but every country
of Europe, Rome lost much of that native virtue to
which she owed her greatness. Roman frugality and
gravity, Roman citizenship and patriotism, Roman
purity and piety, were driven away by Greek luxury
and levity, Greek intriguing and self-seeking, Greek
vice and infidelity. Restrictions and anathemas were
of no avail; and Greek ideas were never so attractive
as when they had been reprobated by Cato and his
friends. Every new generation became more and more
impregnated with Greek. In 131<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> we hear of a
consul (Publius Crassus) who, like another Mezzofanti, was
able to converse in the various dialects of Greek.
Sulla allowed foreign ambassadors to speak Greek
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before the Roman senate.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> The Stoic philosopher
Panætius<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> lived in the house of the Scipios, which
was for a long time the rendezvous of all the literary
celebrities at Rome. Here the Greek historian Polybius,
and the philosopher Cleitomachus, Lucilius the
satirist, Terence the African poet (196-159), and the
improvisatore Archias (102 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>), were welcome
guests.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> In this select circle the master-works of Greek
literature were read and criticised; the problems of
Greek philosophy were discussed; and the highest interests
of human life became the subject of thoughtful
conversation. Though no poet of original genius
arose from this society, it exercised a most powerful
influence on the progress of Roman literature. It
formed a tribunal of good taste; and much of the
correctness, simplicity, and manliness of the classical
Latin is due to that <span class="tei tei-q">“Cosmopolitan Club,”</span> which
met under the hospitable roof of the Scipios.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The religious life of Roman society at the close of
the Punic wars was more Greek than Roman. All
who had learnt to think seriously on religious questions
were either Stoics or followers of Epicurus; or
they embraced the doctrines of the New Academy,
denying the possibility of any knowledge of the Infinite,
and putting opinion in the place of
truth.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>
Though the doctrines of Epicurus and the New Academy
were always considered dangerous and heretical,
the philosophy of the Stoics was tolerated, and a kind
of compromise effected between philosophy and religion.
There was a state-philosophy as well as a state-religion.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Roman priesthood, though they had
succeeded, in 161, in getting all Greek rhetors and
philosophers expelled from Rome, perceived that a
compromise was necessary. It was openly avowed
that in the enlightened classes<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> philosophy must take
the place of religion, but that a belief in miracles and
oracles was necessary for keeping the large masses
in order. Even Cato,<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> the leader of the orthodox,
national, and conservative party, expressed his surprise
that a haruspex, when meeting a colleague, did not
burst out laughing. Men like Scipio Æmilianus and
Lælius professed to believe in the popular gods; but
with them Jupiter was the soul of the universe, the
statues of the gods mere works of art.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> Their
gods, as the people complained, had neither body, parts,
nor passions. Peace, however, was preserved between
the Stoic philosopher and the orthodox priest. Both
parties professed to believe in the same gods, but they
claimed the liberty to believe in them in their own
way.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have dwelt at some length on the changes in the
intellectual atmosphere of Rome at the end of the
Punic wars, and I have endeavored to show how
completely it was impregnated with Greek ideas in
order to explain, what otherwise would seem almost
inexplicable, the zeal and earnestness with which the
study of Greek grammar was taken up at Rome, not
only by a few scholars and philosophers, but by the
leading statesmen of the time. To our minds, discussions
on nouns and verbs, on cases and gender, on
regular and irregular conjugation, retain always something
of the tedious character which these subjects
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had at school, and we can hardly understand how at
Rome, grammar—pure and simple grammar—should
have formed a subject of general interest, and a topic of
fashionable conversation. When one of the first grammarians
of the day, Crates of Pergamus, was sent to
Rome as ambassador of King Attalus, he was received
with the greatest distinction by all the literary statesmen
of the capital. It so happened that when walking
one day on the Palatian hill, Crates caught his foot in
the grating of a sewer, fell and broke his leg. Being
thereby detained at Rome longer than he intended, he
was persuaded to give some public lectures, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">akroaseis</span></em>,
on grammar; and from these lectures, says Suetonius,
dates the study of grammar at Rome. This took place
about 159 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, between the second and third Punic
wars, shortly after the death of Ennius, and two years
after the famous expulsion of the Greek rhetors and
philosophers (161). Four years later Carneades, likewise
sent to Rome as ambassador, was prohibited from
lecturing by Cato. After these lectures of Crates,
grammatical and philological studies became extremely
popular at Rome. We hear of Lucius Ælius Stilo,<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>
who lectured on Latin as Crates had lectured on Greek.
Among his pupils were Varro, Lucilius, and Cicero.
Varro composed twenty-four books on the Latin language,
four of which were dedicated to Cicero. Cicero,
himself, is quoted as an authority on grammatical questions,
though we know of no special work of his on
grammar. Lucilius devoted the ninth book of his
satires to the reform of spelling.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> But nothing shows
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more clearly the wide interest which grammatical studies
had then excited in the foremost ranks of Roman
society than Cæsar's work on Latin grammar. It was
composed by him during the Gallic war, and dedicated
to Cicero, who might well be proud of the compliment
thus paid him by the great general and statesman.
Most of these works are lost to us, and we can judge
of them only by means of casual quotations. Thus we
learn from a fragment of Cæsar's work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De analogia</span></span>,
that he was the inventor of the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ablative</span></em> in Latin.
The word never occurs before, and, of course, could
not be borrowed, like the names of the other cases,
from Greek grammarians, as they admitted no ablative
in Greek. To think of Cæsar fighting the barbarians
of Gaul and Germany, and watching from a distance
the political complications at Rome, ready to grasp the
sceptre of the world, and at the same time carrying on
his philological and grammatical studies together with
his secretary, the Greek Didymus,<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> gives us a
new view both of that extraordinary man, and of the time in
which he lived. After Cæsar had triumphed, one of
his favorite plans was to found a Greek and Latin library
at Rome, and he offered the librarianship to the
best scholar of the day, to Varro, though Varro had
fought against him on the side of Pompey.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have thus arrived at the time when, as we saw
in an earlier part of this lecture, Dionysius Thrax published
the first elementary grammar of Greek at Rome.
Empirical grammar had thus been transplanted to Rome,
the Greek grammatical terminology was translated into
Latin, and in this new Latin garb it has travelled now for
nearly two thousand years over the whole civilized world.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Even in India, where a different terminology had grown
up in the grammatical schools of the Brahmans, a terminology
in some respects more perfect than that of
Alexandria and Rome, we may now hear such words
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">case</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gender</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive</span></em>, explained by
European teachers to their native pupils. The fates of
words are curious indeed, and when I looked the other
day at some of the examination papers of the government
schools in India, such questions as—<span class="tei tei-q">“Write the
genitive case of Siva,”</span> seemed to reduce whole volumes
of history into a single sentence. How did these words,
genitive case, come to India? They came from England,
they had come to England from Rome, to Rome
from Alexandria, to Alexandria from Athens. At
Athens, the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">case</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ptōsis</span></em>, had a philosophical
meaning; at Rome, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">casus</span></em> was merely a literal translation;
the original meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fall</span></em> was lost, and the
word dwindled down to a mere technical term. At
Athens, the philosophy of language was a counterpart
of the philosophy of the mind. The terminology of
formal logic and formal grammar was the same. The
logic of the Stoics was divided into two
parts,<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rhetoric</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dialectic</span></em>, and the latter treated, first, <span class="tei tei-q">“On
that which signifies, or language;”</span> secondly, <span class="tei tei-q">“On that
which is signified, or things.”</span> In their philosophical
language <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ptōsis</span></em>, which the Romans translated by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">casus</span></em>,
really meant fall; that is to say, the inclination or relation
of one idea to another, the falling or resting of
one word on another. Long and angry discussions were
carried on as to whether the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ptōsis</span></em>, or fall, was
applicable to the nominative; and every true Stoic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would have scouted the expression of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">casus rectus</span></em>, because
the subject or the nominative, as they argued, did
not fall or rest on anything else, but stood erect, the
other words of a sentence leaning or depending on it.
All this is lost to us when we speak of cases.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And how are the dark scholars in the government
schools of India to guess the meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genitive</span></em>? The
Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genitivus</span></em> is a mere blunder, for the Greek word
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genikē</span></em> could never mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genitivus</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Genitivus</span></em>, if
it is meant to express the case of origin or birth, would in
Greek have been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gennētikē</span></em>, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genikē</span></em>. Nor does
the genitive express the relation of son to father. For
though we may say, <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of the father,”</span> we may
likewise say, <span class="tei tei-q">“the father of the son.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Genikē</span></em>, in Greek,
had a much wider, a much more philosophical meaning.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>
It meant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">casus generalis</span></em>, the general case, or
rather the case which expresses the gentus or kind.
This is the real power of the genitive. If I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“a
bird of the water,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“of the water”</span> defines the genus
to which a certain bird belongs; it refers it to the genus
of water-birds. <span class="tei tei-q">“Man of the mountains,”</span> means a
mountaineer. In phrases such as <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the father,”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“father of the son,”</span> the genitives have the same
effect. They predicate something of the son or of the
father; and if we distinguished between the sons of
the father, and the sons of the mother, the genitives
would mark the class or genus to which the sons respectively
belonged. They would answer the same purpose
as the adjectives, paternal and maternal. It can
be proved etymologically that the termination of the
genitive is, in most cases, identical with those derivative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suffixes by which substantives are changed into adjectives.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is hardly necessary to trace the history of what I
call the empirical study, or the grammatical analysis of
language, beyond Rome. With Dionysius Thrax the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
framework of grammar was finished. Later writers
have improved and completed it, but they have added
nothing really new and original. We can follow the
stream of grammatical science from Dionysius Thrax to
our own time in an almost uninterrupted chain of
Greek and Roman writers. We find Quintilian in the
first century; Scaurus, Apollonius Dyscolus, and his son,
Herodianus, in the second; Probus and Donatus in the
fourth. After Constantine had moved the seat of government
from Rome, grammatical science received a new
home in the academy of Constantinople. There were no
less than twenty Greek and Latin grammarians who
held professorships at Constantinople. Under Justinian,
in the sixth century, the name of Priscianus gave
a new lustre to grammatical studies, and his work remained
an authority during the Middle Ages to nearly
our own times. We ourselves have been taught grammar
according to the plan which was followed by
Dionysius at Rome, by Priscianus at Constantinople,
by Alcuin at York; and whatever may be said of the
improvements introduced into our system of education,
the Greek and Latin grammars used at our public
schools are mainly founded on the first empirical analysis
of language, prepared by the philosophers of Athens,
applied by the scholars of Alexandria, and transferred
to the practical purpose of teaching a foreign tongue by
the Greek professors at Rome.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We traced, in our last lecture, the origin and progress
of the empirical study of languages from the time
of Plato and Aristotle to our own school-boy days.
We saw at what time, and under what circumstances,
the first grammatical analysis of language took place;
how its component parts, the parts of speech, were
named, and how, with the aid of a terminology, half
philosophical and half empirical, a system of teaching
languages was established, which, whatever we may
think of its intrinsic value, has certainly answered that
purpose for which it was chiefly intended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering the process by which this system of
grammatical science was elaborated, it could not be
expected to give us an insight into the nature of language.
The division into nouns and verbs, articles
and conjunctions, the schemes of declension and conjugation,
were a merely artificial network thrown over
the living body of language. We must not look in the
grammar of Dionysius Thrax for a correct and well-articulated
skeleton of human speech. It is curious,
however, to observe the striking coincidences between
the grammatical terminology of the Greeks and the
Hindús, which would seem to prove that there must
be some true and natural foundation for the much-abused
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grammatical system of the schools. The Hindús
are the only nation that cultivated the science of
grammar without having received any impulse, directly
or indirectly, from the Greeks. Yet we find in Sanskrit
too the same system of cases, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vibhakti</span></span>, or
inflections, the active, passive, and middle voices, the
tenses, moods, and persons, divided not exactly, but
very nearly, in the same manner as in Greek.<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> In
Sanskrit, grammar is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vyâkaraņa</span></span>, which means
analysis or taking to pieces. As Greek grammar owed
its origin to the critical study of Homer, Sanskrit
grammar arose from the study of the Vedas, the most
ancient poetry of the Brahmans. The differences between
the dialect of these sacred hymns and the literary
Sanskrit of later ages were noted and preserved
with a religious care. We still possess the first essays
in the grammatical science of the Brahmans, the so-called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prâtiśâkhyas</span></span>. These works, though they merely
profess to give rules on the proper pronunciation of the
ancient dialect of the Vedas, furnish us at the same
time with observations of a grammatical character, and
particularly with those valuable lists of words, irregular
or in any other way remarkable, the Gaņas. These
supplied that solid basis on which successive generations
of scholars erected the astounding structure
that reached its perfection in the grammar of Pâņini.
There is no form, regular or irregular, in the whole
Sanskrit language, which is not provided for in the
grammar of Pâņini and his commentators. It is the
perfection of a merely empirical analysis of language,
unsurpassed, nay even unapproached, by anything in
the grammatical literature of other nations. Yet of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the real nature, and natural growth of language, it
teaches us nothing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then do we know of language after we have
learnt the grammar of Greek or Sanskrit, or after we
have transferred the network of classical grammar to
our own tongue?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know certain forms of language which correspond
to certain forms of thought. We know that
the subject must assume the form of the nominative,
the object that of the accusative. We know that the
more remote object may be put in the dative, and that
the predicate, in its most general form, may be rendered
by the genitive. We are taught that whereas in English
the genitive is marked by a final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, or by the preposition
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em>, it is in Greek expressed by a final ος, in
Latin by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>. But what this ος and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> represent, why
they should have the power of changing a nominative
into a genitive, a subject into a predicate, remains a
riddle. It is self-evident that each language, in order
to be a language, must be able to distinguish the subject
from the object, the nominative from the accusative.
But how a mere change of termination should
suffice to convey so material a distinction would seem
almost incomprehensible. If we look for a moment
beyond Greek and Latin, we see that there are in
reality but few languages which have distinct forms
for these two categories of thought. Even in Greek
and Latin there is no outward distinction between the
nominative and accusative of neuters. The Chinese
language, it is commonly said, has no grammar at all,
that is to say, it has no inflections, no declension and
conjugation, in our sense of these words; it makes no
formal distinction of the various parts of speech, noun,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verb, adjective, adverb, &amp;c. Yet there is no shade of
thought that cannot be rendered in Chinese. The
Chinese have no more difficulty in distinguishing between
<span class="tei tei-q">“James beats John,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“John beats James,”</span>
than the Greeks and Romans or we ourselves. They
have no termination for the accusative, but they attain
the same by always placing the subject before, and the
object after the verb, or by employing words, before or
after the noun, which clearly indicate that it is to be
taken as the object of the verb.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> There are other languages
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which have more terminations even than Greek
and Latin. In Finnish there are fifteen cases, expressive
of every possible relation between the subject and
the object; but there is no accusative, no purely objective
case. In English and French the distinctive
terminations of the nominative and accusative have
been worn off by phonetic corruption, and these languages
are obliged, like Chinese, to mark the subject
and object by the collocation of words. What we
learn therefore at school in being taught that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rex</span></em> in the
nominative becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regem</span></em> in the accusative, is simply
a practical rule. We know when to say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rex</span></em>, and when
to say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regem</span></em>. But why the king as a subject should
be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rex</span></em>, and as an object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regem</span></em>, remains entirely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unexplained. In the same manner we learn that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amo</span></em>
means I love, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amavi</span></em> I loved; but why that tragical
change from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no love</span></em> should be represented by
the simple change of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">o</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">avi</span></em>, or, in English, by the
addition of a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em>, is neither asked nor answered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now if there is a science of language, these are the
questions which it will have to answer. If they cannot
be answered, if we must be content with paradigms
and rules, if the terminations of nouns and verbs must
be looked upon either as conventional contrivances or
as mysterious excrescences, there is no such thing as a
science of language, and we must be satisfied with
what has been called the art (τέχνη) of language, or
grammar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before we either accept or decline the solution of
any problem, it is right to determine what means there
are for solving it. Beginning with English we should
ask, what means have we for finding out why <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em>
should mean I am actually loving, whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em> indicates
that that feeling is past and gone? Or, if we
look to languages richer in inflections than English,
by what process can we discover under what circumstances
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amo</span></em>, I love, was changed, through the mere addition
of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></em>, into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amor</span></em>, expressing no longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em>,
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I am loved</span></em>? Did declensions and conjugations bud
forth like the blossoms of a tree? Were they imparted
to man ready made by some mysterious power? Or
did some wise people invent them, assigning certain
letters to certain phases of thought, as mathematicians
express unknown quantities by freely chosen algebraic
exponents? We are here brought at once face to face
with the highest and most difficult problem of our
science, the origin of language. But it will be well
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the present to turn our eyes away from theories,
and fix our attention at first entirely on facts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us keep to the English perfect, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>, as compared
with the present, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em>. We cannot embrace at
once the whole English grammar, but if we can track
one form to its true lair, we shall probably have no
difficulty in digging out the rest of the brood. Now,
if we ask how the addition of a final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em> could express
the momentous transition from being in love to being
indifferent, the first thing we have to do, before attempting
any explanation, would be to establish the
earliest and most original form of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>. This is a
rule which even Plato recognized in his philosophy of
language, though, we must confess, he seldom obeyed
it. We know what havoc phonetic corruption may
make both in the dictionary and the grammar of a
language, and it would be a pity to waste our conjectures
on formations which a mere reference to the history
of language would suffice to explain. Now a very
slight acquaintance with the history of the English
language teaches us that the grammar of modern English
is not the same as the grammar of Wycliffe.
Wycliffe's English again may be traced back to what,
with Sir Frederick Madden, we may call Middle
English, from 1500 to 1330; Middle English to Early
English, from 1330 to 1230; Early English to Semi-Saxon
from 1230 to 1100; and Semi-Saxon to Anglo-Saxon.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
It is evident that if we are to discover the
original intention of the syllable which changes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em>
into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>, we must consult the original form of that
syllable wherever we can find it. We should never
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have known that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">priest</span></em> meant originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an elder</span></em>, unless
we had traced it back to its original form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presbyter</span></em>,
in which a Greek scholar at once recognizes the comparative
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presbys</span></em>, old. If left to modern English
alone, we might attempt to connect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">priest</span></em> with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">praying</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preaching</span></em>, but we should not thus arrive at its true
derivation. The modern word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel</span></em> conveys no
meaning at all. As soon as we trace it back to the
original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Goddspell</span></em>, we see that it is a literal translation
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelium</span></em>, or good news, good tidings.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord</span></em>
would be nothing but an empty title in English, unless
we could discover its original form and meaning in the
Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hlafford</span></em>, meaning a giver of bread, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hlaf</span></em>, a loaf, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ford</span></em>, to give.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even after this is done, after we have traced a
modern English word back to Anglo-Saxon, it follows
by no means that we should there find it in its original
form, or that we should succeed in forcing it to disclose
its original intention. Anglo-Saxon is not an original
or aboriginal language. It points by its very name
to the Saxons and Angles of the continent. We
have, therefore, to follow our word from Anglo-Saxon
through the various Saxon and Low-German dialects,
till we arrive at last at the earliest stage of German
which is within our reach, the Gothic of the fourth
century after Christ. Even here we cannot rest. For,
although we cannot trace Gothic back to any earlier
Teutonic language, we see at once that Gothic, too,
is a modern language, and that it must have passed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through numerous phases of growth before it became
what it is in the mouth of Bishop Ulfilas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then are we to do?—We must try to do
what is done when we have to deal with the modern
Romance languages. If we could not trace a French
word back to Latin, we should look for its corresponding
form in Italian, and endeavor to trace the Italian
to its Latin source. If, for instance, we were doubtful
about the origin of the French word for fire, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em>, we
have but to look to the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuoco</span></em>, in order to see at
once that both <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuoco</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em> are derived from the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">focus</span></em>. We can do this, because we know that French
and Italian are cognate dialects, and because we have
ascertained beforehand the exact degree of relationship
in which they stand to each other. Had we, instead
of looking to Italian, looked to German for an explanation
of the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em>, we should have missed the
right track; for the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feuer</span></em>, though more like
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em> than the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuoco</span></em>, could never have assumed
in French the form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, in the case of the preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hors</span></em>, which in
French means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em>, we can more easily determine
its origin after we have found that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hors</span></em> corresponds
with the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuora</span></em>, the Spanish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuera</span></em>. The French
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fromage</span></em>, cheese, derives no light from Latin. But as
soon as we compare the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formaggio</span></em>,<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> we see that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formaggio</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fromage</span></em> are derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forma</span></em>;
cheese being made in Italy by keeping the milk in small baskets
or forms. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Feeble</span></em>, the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faible</span></em>, is clearly
derived from Latin; but it is not till we see the
Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fievole</span></em> that we are reminded of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">flebilis</span></em>,
tearful. We should never have found the etymology,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that is to say the origin, of the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">payer</span></em>, the
English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to pay</span></em>, if we did not consult the dictionary
of the cognate dialects, such as Italian and Spanish.
Here we find that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to pay</span></em> is expressed in Italian by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pagare</span></em>, in Spanish by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pagar</span></em>, whereas in Provençal
we actually find the two forms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pagar</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">payar</span></em>. Now
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pagar</span></em> clearly points back to Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pacare</span></em>, which means
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to pacify</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to appease</span></em>. To appease a creditor meant to
pay him; in the same manner as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">une quittance</span></em>, a quittance
or receipt, was originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quietantia</span></em>, a quieting,
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quietus</span></em>, quiet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, therefore, we wish to follow up our researches,—if,
not satisfied with having traced an English word
back to Gothic, we want to know what it was at a still
earlier period of its growth,—we must determine
whether there are any languages that stand to Gothic
in the same relation in which Italian and Spanish stand
to French;—we must restore, as far as possible, the
genealogical tree of the various families of human
speech. In doing this we enter on the second or
classificatory stage of our science; for genealogy,
where it is applicable, is the most perfect form of
classification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before we proceed to examine the results which
have been obtained by the recent labors of Schlegel,
Humboldt, Bopp, Burnouf, Pott, Benfey, Prichard,
Grimm, Kuhn, Curtius, and others in this branch of
the science of language, it will be well to glance at
what had been achieved before their time in the classification
of the numberless dialects of mankind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greeks never thought of applying the principle
of classification to the varieties of human speech.
They only distinguished between Greek on one side,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and all other languages on the other, comprehended
under the convenient name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Barbarous.”</span> They
succeeded, indeed, in classifying four of their own
dialects with tolerable correctness,<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> but they applied
the term <span class="tei tei-q">“barbarous”</span> so promiscuously to the other
more distant relatives of Greek, (the dialects of the
Pelasgians, Carians, Macedonians, Thracians, and Illyrians,)
that, for the purposes of scientific classification,
it is almost impossible to make any use of the statements
of ancient writers about these so-called barbarous
idioms.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plato, indeed, in his Cratylus (c. 36), throws out a
hint that the Greeks might have received their own
words from the barbarians, the barbarians being older
than the Greeks. But he was not able to see the full
bearing of this remark. He only points out that some
words, such as the names of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fire</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">water</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dog</span></em>, were
the same in Phrygian and Greek; and he supposes that
the Greeks borrowed them from the Phrygians (c. 26).
The idea that the Greek language and that of the barbarians
could have had a common source never entered
his mind. It is strange that even so comprehensive a
mind as that of Aristotle should have failed to perceive
in languages some of that law and order which he
tried to discover in every realm of nature. As Aristotle,
however, did not attempt this, we need not wonder
that it was not attempted by any one else for the
next two thousand years. The Romans, in all scientific
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
matters, were merely the parrots of the Greeks.
Having themselves been called barbarians, they soon
learnt to apply the same name to all other nations,
except, of course, to their masters, the Greeks. Now
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">barbarian</span></em> is one of those lazy expressions which seem
to say everything but in reality say nothing. It was
applied as recklessly as the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heretic</span></em> during the
Middle Ages. If the Romans had not received this
convenient name of barbarian ready made for them,
they would have treated their neighbors, the Celts
and Germans, with more respect and sympathy: they
would, at all events, have looked at them with a more
discriminating eye. And, if they had done so, they
would have discovered, in spite of outward differences,
that these barbarians were, after all, not very
distant cousins. There was as much similarity between
the language of Cæsar and the barbarians
against whom he fought in Gaul and Germany as
there was between his language and that of Homer.
A man of Cæsar's sagacity would have seen this, if he
had not been blinded by traditional phraseology. I
am not exaggerating. For let us look at one instance
only. If we take a verb of such constant occurrence
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to have</span></em>, we shall find the paradigms almost identical
in Latin and Gothic:—

It surely required a certain amount of blindness, or
rather of deafness, not to perceive such similarity, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that blindness or deafness arose, I believe, entirely from
the single word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">barbarian</span></em>. Not till that word barbarian
was struck out of the dictionary of mankind, and
replaced by brother, not till the right of all nations of
the world to be classed as members of one genus or
kind was recognized, can we look even for the first
beginnings of our science. This change was effected
by Christianity. To the Hindú, every man not twice-born
was a Mlechha; to the Greek, every man not
speaking Greek was a barbarian; to the Jew, every
person not circumcised was a Gentile; to the Mohammedan,
every man not believing in the prophet is a
Giaur or Kaffir. It was Christianity which first broke
down the barriers between Jew and Gentile, between
Greek and barbarian, between the white and the black.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Humanity</span></em> is a word which you look for in vain in Plato
or Aristotle; the idea of mankind as one family, as the
children of one God, is an idea of Christian growth;
and the science of mankind, and of the languages of
mankind, is a science which, without Christianity,
would never have sprung into life. When people
had been taught to look upon all men as brethren,
then, and then only, did the variety of human speech
present itself as a problem that called for a solution in
the eyes of thoughtful observers; and I, therefore, date
the real beginning of the science of language from the
first day of Pentecost. After that day of cloven
tongues a new light is spreading over the world, and
objects rise into view which had been hidden from the
eyes of the nations of antiquity. Old words assume a
new meaning, old problems a new interest, old sciences
a new purpose. The common origin of mankind, the
differences of race and language, the susceptibility of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all nations of the highest mental culture, these become,
in the new world in which we live, problems of scientific,
because of more than scientific, interest. It is no
valid objection that so many centuries should have
elapsed before the spirit which Christianity infused into
every branch of scientific inquiry produced visible results.
We see in the oaken fleet which rides the ocean
the small acorn which was buried in the ground hundreds
of years ago, and we recognize in the philosophy
of Albertus Magnus,<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
though nearly 1200 years after the death of Christ, in the aspirations
of Kepler,<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> and
in the researches of the greatest philosophers of our
own age, the sound of that key-note of thought which
had been struck for the first time by the apostle of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gentiles:<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">For the invisible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we shall see that the science of language owes
more than its first impulse to Christianity. The pioneers
of our science were those very apostles who were
commanded <span class="tei tei-q">“to go into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature,”</span> and their true successors, the
missionaries of the whole Christian Church. Translations
of the Lord's Prayer or of the Bible into every
dialect of the world, form even now the most valuable
materials for the comparative philologist. As long as
the number of known languages was small, the idea of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
classification hardly suggested itself. The mind must
be bewildered by the multiplicity of facts before it has recourse
to division. As long as the only languages studied
were Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, the simple division
into sacred and profane, or classical and oriental, sufficed.
But when theologians extended their studies to Arabic,
Chaldee, and Syriac, a step, and a very important step,
was made towards the establishment of a class or family
of languages.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>
No one could help seeing that these languages
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were most intimately related to each other, and
that they differed from Greek and Latin on all points
on which they agreed among themselves. As early as
1606 we find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guichard</span></span>,<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>
in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Harmonie Etymologique,”</span>
placing Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac as a class
of languages by themselves, and distinguishing besides
between the Romance and Teutonic dialects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What prevented, however, for a long time the progress
of the science of language was the idea that Hebrew
was the primitive language of mankind, and that,
therefore, all languages must be derived from Hebrew.
The fathers of the Church never expressed any doubt on
this point. St. Jerome, in one of his epistles to Damasus,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>
writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole of antiquity (universa antiquitas)
affirms that Hebrew, in which the Old Testament
is written, was the beginning of all human speech.”</span>
Origen, in his eleventh Homily on the book of Numbers,
expresses his belief that the Hebrew language, originally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
given through Adam, remained in that part of the
world which was the chosen portion of God, not left like
the rest to one of His angels.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> When, therefore, the
first attempts at a classification of languages were made,
the problem, as it presented itself to scholars such as
Guichard and Thomassin, was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“As Hebrew is
undoubtedly the mother of all languages, how are we to
explain the process by which Hebrew became split into
so many dialects, and how can these numerous dialects,
such as Greek, and Latin, Coptic, Persian, Turkish, be
traced back to their common source, the Hebrew?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is astonishing what an amount of real learning and
ingenuity was wasted on this question during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. It finds, perhaps, but
one parallel in the laborious calculations and constructions
of early astronomers, who had to account for the
movements of the heavenly bodies, always taking it for
granted that the earth must be the fixed centre of our
planetary system. But, although we know now that
the labors of such scholars as Thomassin were, and
could not be otherwise than fruitless, it would be a most
discouraging view to take of the progress of the human
race, were we to look upon the exertions of eminent
men in former ages, though they may have been in a
wrong direction, as mere vanity and vexation of spirit.
We must not forget that the very fact of the failure of
such men contributed powerfully to a general conviction
that there must be something wrong in the problem itself,
till at last a bolder genius inverted the problem and
thereby solved it. When books after books had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
written to show how Greek and Latin and all other
languages were derived from Hebrew,<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> and when not
one single system proved satisfactory, people asked at
last—<span class="tei tei-q">“Why then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should</span></em> all languages be derived from
Hebrew?”</span>—and this very question solved the problem.
It might have been natural for theologians in the fourth
and fifth centuries, many of whom knew neither Hebrew
nor any language except their own, to take it for granted
that Hebrew was the source of all languages, but there
is neither in the Old nor the New Testament a single
word to necessitate this view. Of the language of
Adam we know nothing; but if Hebrew, as we know
it, was one of the languages that sprang from the confusion
of tongues at Babel, it could not well have been
the language of Adam or of the whole earth, <span class="tei tei-q">“when
the whole earth was still of one speech.”</span><a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although, therefore, a certain advance was made
towards a classification of languages by the Semitic
scholars of the seventeenth century, yet this partial
advance became in other respects an impediment.
The purely scientific interest in arranging languages
according to their characteristic features was lost sight
of, and erroneous ideas were propagated, the influence
of which has even now not quite subsided.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first who really conquered the prejudice that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hebrew was the source of all language was Leibniz,
the cotemporary and rival of Newton. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is as
much reason,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for supposing Hebrew to have
been the primitive language of mankind, as there is for
adopting the view of Goropius, who published a work
at Antwerp, in 1580, to prove that Dutch was the
language spoken in Paradise.”</span><a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> In a
letter to Tenzel, Leibniz writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“To call Hebrew the primitive language,
is like calling branches of a tree primitive
branches, or like imagining that in some country hewn
trunks could grow instead of trees. Such ideas may
be conceived, but they do not agree with the laws of
nature, and with the harmony of the universe, that is
to say with the Divine Wisdom.”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Leibniz did more than remove this one great
stumbling-block from the threshold of the science of
language. He was the first to apply the principle of
sound inductive reasoning to a subject which before
him had only been treated at random. He pointed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out the necessity of collecting, first of all, as large a
number of facts as possible.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>
He appealed to missionaries, travellers, ambassadors, princes, and emperors, to
help him in a work which he had so much at heart.
The Jesuits in China had to work for him.
Witsen,<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>
the traveller, sent him a most precious present, a translation
of the Lord's Prayer into the jargon of the Hottentots.
<span class="tei tei-q">“My friend,”</span> writes Leibniz in thanking him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“remember, I implore you, and remind your Muscovite
friends, to make researches in order to procure
specimens of the Scythian languages, the Samoyedes,
Siberians, Bashkirs, Kalmuks, Tungusians, and others.”</span>
Having made the acquaintance of Peter the Great,
Leibniz wrote to him the following letter, dated Vienna,
October the 26th, 1713:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have suggested that the numerous languages,
hitherto almost entirely unknown and unstudied, which
are current in the empire of your Majesty and on its
frontiers, should be reduced to writing; also that dictionaries,
or at least small vocabularies, should be collected,
and translations be procured in such languages
of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the
Apostolic Symbolum, and other parts of the Catechism,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ut omnis lingua laudet Dominum</span></em>. This would increase
the glory of your Majesty, who reigns over so many
nations, and is so anxious to improve them; and it
would, likewise, by means of a comparison of languages,
enable us to discover the origin of those nations
who from Scythia, which is subject to your
Majesty, advanced into other countries. But principally
it would help to plant Christianity among the
nations speaking those dialects, and I have, therefore,
addressed the Most Rev. Metropolitan on the same
subject.”</span><a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leibniz drew up a list of the most simple and necessary
terms which should be selected for comparison in
various languages. At home, while engaged in historical
researches, he collected whatever could throw light
on the origin of the German language, and he encouraged
others, such as Eccard, to do the same. He
pointed out the importance of dialects, and even of provincial
and local terms, for elucidating the etymological
structure of languages.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>
Leibniz never undertook a systematic classification of the whole realm of language,
nor was he successful in classing the dialects with
which he had become acquainted. He distinguished
between a Japhetic and Aramaic class, the former
occupying the north, the latter the south, of the continent
of Asia and Europe. He believed in a common
origin of languages, and in a migration of the human
race from east to west. But he failed to distinguish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the exact degrees of relationship in which languages
stood to each other, and he mixed up some of the
Turanian dialects, such as Finnish and Tataric, with
the Japhetic family of speech. If Leibniz had found
time to work out all the plans which his fertile and
comprehensive genius conceived, or if he had been
understood and supported by cotemporary scholars, the
science of language, as one of the inductive sciences,
might have been established a century earlier. But a
man like Leibniz, who was equally distinguished as a
scholar, a theologian, a lawyer, an historian, and a mathematician,
could only throw out hints as to how language
ought to be studied. Leibniz was not only the
discoverer of the differential calculus. He was one
of the first to watch the geological stratification of
the earth. He was engaged in constructing a calculating
machine, the idea of which he first conceived
as a boy. He drew up an elaborate plan of an expedition
to Egypt, which he submitted to Louis XIV. in
order to avert his attention from the frontiers of Germany.
The same man was engaged in a long correspondence
with Bossuet to bring about a reconciliation
between Protestants and Romanists, and he endeavored,
in his Theodicée and other works, to defend the
cause of truth and religion against the inroads of the
materialistic philosophy of England and France. It
has been said, indeed, that the discoveries of Leibniz
produced but little effect, and that most of them had
to be made again. This is not the case, however, with
regard to the science of language. The new interest
in languages, which Leibniz had called into life, did
not die again. After it had once been recognized as
a desideratum to bring together a complete <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herbarium</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the languages of mankind, missionaries and travellers
felt it their duty to collect lists of words, and draw
up grammars wherever they came in contact with a
new race. The two great works in which, at the beginning
of our century, the results of these researches
were summed up, I mean the Catalogue of Languages
by Hervas, and the Mithridates of Adelung, can both
be traced back directly to the influence of Leibniz.
As to Hervas, he had read Leibniz carefully, and
though he differs from him on some points, he fully
acknowledges his merits in promoting a truly philosophical
study of languages. Of Adelung's Mithridates
and his obligations to Leibniz we shall have to
speak presently.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hervas lived from 1735 to 1809. He was a Spaniard
by birth, and a Jesuit by profession. While working
as a missionary among the Polyglottous tribes of
America, his attention was drawn to a systematic study
of languages. After his return, he lived chiefly at
Rome in the midst of the numerous Jesuit missionaries
who had been recalled from all parts of the world, and
who, by their communications on the dialects of the
tribes among whom they had been laboring, assisted
him greatly in his researches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of his works were written in Italian, and were
afterwards translated into Spanish. We cannot enter
into the general scope of his literary labors, which are
of the most comprehensive character. They were intended
to form a kind of Kosmos, for which he chose
the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea del Universo</span></span>.”</span> What is of interest
to us is that portion which treats of man and language
as part of the universe; and here, again, chiefly his
Catalogue of Languages, in six volumes, published in
Spanish in the year 1800.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we compare the work of Hervas with a similar
work which excited much attention towards the end
of the last century, and is even now more widely
known than Hervas, I mean Court de Gebelin's
<span class="tei tei-q">“Monde Primitif,”</span><a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> we shall see at once how far
superior the Spanish Jesuit is to the French philosopher.
Gebelin treats Persian, Armenian, Malay, and
Coptic as dialects of Hebrew; he speaks of Bask as
a dialect of Celtic, and he tries to discover Hebrew,
Greek, English, and French words in the idioms of
America. Hervas, on the contrary, though embracing
in his catalogue five times the number of languages
that were known to Gebelin, is most careful not to
allow himself to be carried away by theories not
warranted by the evidence before him. It is easy
now to point out mistakes and inaccuracies in Hervas,
but I think that those who have blamed him most are
those who ought most to have acknowledged their
obligations to him. To have collected specimens and
notices of more than 300 languages is no small matter.
But Hervas did more. He himself composed grammars
of more than forty languages.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> He was the first
to point out that the true affinities of languages must
be determined chiefly by grammatical evidence, not by
mere similarity of words.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>
He proved, by a comparative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
list of declensions and conjugations, that Hebrew,
Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Amharic are
all but dialects of one original language, and constitute
one family of speech, the Semitic.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> He scouted
the idea of deriving all the languages of mankind from
Hebrew. He had perceived clear traces of affinity in
Hungarian, Lapponian, and Finnish, three dialects
now classed as members of the Turanian family.<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> He
had proved that Bask was not, as was commonly supposed,
a Celtic dialect, but an independent language,
spoken by the earliest inhabitants of Spain, as proved
by the names of the Spanish mountains and rivers.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>
Nay, one of the most brilliant discoveries in the history
of the science of language, the establishment of
the Malay and Polynesian family of speech, extending
from the island of Madagascar east of Africa, over 208
degrees of longitude, to the Easter Islands west of
America,<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> was made by Hervas long before it was
announced to the world by Humboldt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hervas was likewise aware of the great grammatical
similarity between Sanskrit and Greek, but the imperfect
information which he received from his friend, the
Carmelite missionary, Fra Paolino de San Bartolomeo,
the author of the first Sanskrit grammar, published at
Rome in 1790, prevented him from seeing the full
meaning of this grammatical similarity. How near
Hervas was to the discovery of the truth may be seen
from his comparing such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theos</span></em>, God, in Greek,
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Deva</span></em>, God, in Sanskrit. He identified the Greek
auxiliary verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eimi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eis</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esti</span></em>, I am, thou art, he
is, with the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asmi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asti</span></em>. He even
pointed out that the terminations of the three genders<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> in Greek, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">os</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ē</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on</span></em>, are the same as the Sanskrit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">â</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">am</span></em>. But believing,
as he did, that the Greeks derived their philosophy
and mythology from India,<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> he supposed that
they had likewise borrowed from the Hindus some of
their words, and even the art of distinguishing the
gender of words.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second work which represents the science of
language at the beginning of this century, and which
is, to a still greater extent, the result of the impulse
which Leibniz had given, is the Mithridates of Adelung.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>
Adelung's work depends partly on Hervas,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
partly on the collections of words which had been made
under the auspices of the Russian government. Now
these collections are clearly due to Leibniz. Although
Peter the Great had no time or taste for philological
studies, the government kept the idea of collecting all
the languages of the Russian empire steadily in view.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
Still greater luck was in store for the science of language.
Having been patronized by Cæsar at Rome, it
found a still more devoted patroness in the great Cesarina
of the North, Catherine the Great (1762-1796).
Even as Grand-duchess Catherine was engrossed with
the idea of a Universal Dictionary, on the plan suggested
by Leibniz. She encouraged the chaplain of
the British Factory at St. Petersburg, the Rev. Daniel
Dumaresq, to undertake the work, and he is said to
have published, at her desire, a <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Vocabulary
of Eastern Languages,”</span> in quarto; a work,
however, which, if ever published, is now completely
lost. The reputed author died in London in 1805, at
the advanced age of eighty-four. When Catherine
came to the throne, her plans of conquest hardly absorbed
more of her time than her philological studies;
and she once shut herself up nearly a year, devoting
all her time to the compilation of her Comparative
Dictionary. A letter of hers to Zimmermann, dated the
9th of May, 1785, may interest some of my hearers:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your letter,”</span> she writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“has drawn me from the
solitude in which I had shut myself up for nearly nine
months, and from which I found it hard to stir. You
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will not guess what I have been about. I will tell you,
for such things do not happen every day. I have been
making a list of from two to three hundred radical
words of the Russian language, and I have had them
translated into as many languages and jargons as I
could find. Their number exceeds already the second
hundred. Every day I took one of these words and
wrote it out in all the languages which I could collect.
This has taught me that the Celtic is like the Ostiakian:
that what means sky in one language means
cloud, fog, vault, in others; that the word God in certain
dialects means Good, the Highest, in others, sun
or fire. (Up to here her letter is written in French;
then follows a line of German.) I became tired of
my hobby, after I had read your book on Solitude.
(Then again in French.) But as I should have been
sorry to throw such a mass of paper in the fire;—besides,
the room, six fathoms in length, which I use
as a boudoir in my hermitage, was pretty well warmed—I
asked Professor Pallas to come to me, and after
making an honest confession of my sin, we agreed to
publish these collections, and thus make them useful
to those who like to occupy themselves with the forsaken
toys of others. We are only waiting for some
more dialects of Eastern Siberia. Whether the world
at large will or will not see in this work bright ideas
of different kinds, must depend on the disposition of
their minds, and does not concern me in the least.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If an empress rides a hobby, there are many ready
to help her. Not only were all Russian ambassadors
instructed to collect materials; not only did German
professors<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> supply grammars and dictionaries, but

Washington himself, in order to please the empress,
sent her list of words to all governors and generals
of the United States, enjoining them to supply the
equivalents from the American dialects. The first
volume of the Imperial Dictionary<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> appeared in 1787,
containing a list of 285 words translated into fifty-one
European, and 149 Asiatic languages. Though full
credit should be given to the empress for this remarkable
undertaking, it is but fair to remember that it was
the philosopher who, nearly a hundred years before,
sowed the seed that fell into good ground.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As collections, the works of Hervas, of the Empress
Catherine, and of Adelung, are highly important,
though, such is the progress made in the classification
of languages during the last fifty years, that few people
would now consult them. Besides, the principle
of classification which is followed in these works can
hardly claim to be called scientific. Languages are arranged
geographically, as the languages of Europe, Asia,
Africa, America, and Polynesia, though, at the same
time, natural affinities are admitted which would unite
dialects spoken at a distance of 208 degrees. Languages
seemed to float about like islands on the ocean
of human speech; they did not shoot together to form
themselves into larger continents. This is a most critical
period in the history of every science, and if it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had not been for a happy accident, which, like an electric
spark, caused the floating elements to crystallize
into regular forms, it is more than doubtful whether
the long list of languages and dialects, enumerated and
described in the works of Hervas and Adelung, could
long have sustained the interest of the student of languages.
This electric spark was the discovery of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit is the ancient language of the Hindus.
It had ceased to be a spoken language at least 300 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>
At that time the people of India spoke dialects standing
to the ancient Vedic Sanskrit in the relation of
Italian to Latin. We know some of these dialects,
for there were more than one in various parts of India,
from the inscriptions which the famous King Aśoka
had engraved on the rocks of Dhauli, Girnar, and
Kapurdigiri, and which have been deciphered by Prinsep,
Norris, Wilson, and Burnouf. We can watch
the further growth of these local dialects in the so-called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pâli</span></em>, the sacred language of Buddhism in Ceylon,
and once the popular dialect of the country where
Buddhism took its origin, the modern Behár, the ancient
Magadha.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a> We meet the same local dialects
again in what are called the Prâkrit idioms, used in
the later plays, in the sacred literature of the Jainas,
and in a few poetical compositions; and we see at last
how, through a mixture with the languages of the
various conquerors of India, the Arabic, Persian,
Mongolic, and Turkish, and through a concomitant
corruption of their grammatical system, they were
changed into the modern Hindí, Hindustání, Mahrattí,
and Bengálí. During all this time, however,
Sanskrit continued as the literary language of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Brahmans. Like Latin, it did not die in giving birth
to its numerous offspring; and even at the present day,
an educated Brahman would write with greater fluency
in Sanskrit than in Bengálí. Sanskrit was what Greek
was at Alexandria, what Latin was during the Middle
Ages. It was the classical and at the same time the
sacred language of the Brahmans, and in it were written
their sacred hymns, the Vedas, and the later works,
such as the laws of Manu and the Purâņas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existence of such a language as the ancient
idiom of the country, and the vehicle of a large literature,
was known at all times; and if there are still any
doubts, like those expressed by Dugald Stewart in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Conjectures concerning the Origin of the
Sanskrit,”</span><a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
as to its age and authenticity, they will be best removed
by a glance at the history of India, and at the
accounts given by the writers of different nations that
became successively acquainted with the language and
literature of that country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The argument that nearly all the names of persons
and places in India mentioned by Greek and Roman
writers are pure Sanskrit, has been handled so fully
and ably by others, that nothing more remains to be
said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next nation after the Greeks that became acquainted
with the language and literature of India was
the Chinese. Though Buddhism was not recognized
as a third state-religion before the year 65 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a. d.</span></span>, under
the Emperor Ming-ti,<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> Buddhist missionaries reached
China from India as early as the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>
One Buddhist missionary is mentioned in the Chinese
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
annals in the year 217; and about the year 120 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>,
a Chinese general, after defeating the barbarous tribes
north of the desert of Gobi, brought back as a trophy
a golden statue, the statue of Buddha. The very name
of Buddha, changed in Chinese into Fo-t'o and
Fo,<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> is
pure Sanskrit, and so is every word and every thought
of that religion. The language which the Chinese pilgrims
went to India to study, as the key to the sacred
literature of Buddhism, was Sanskrit. They call it
Fan; but Fan, as M. Stanislas Julien has shown, is an
abbreviation of Fan-lan-mo, and this is the only way
in which the Sanskrit Brahman could be rendered in
Chinese.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> We read of the Emperor
Ming-ti, of the dynasty of Han, sending Tsaï-in and other high officials
to India, in order to study there the doctrine of
Buddha. They engaged the services of two learned
Buddhists, Matânga and Tchou-fa-lan, and some of
the most important Buddhist works were translated by
them into Chinese. The intellectual intercourse between
the Indian peninsula and the northern continent
of Asia continued uninterrupted for several centuries.
Missions were sent from China to India to report on
the religious, political, social, and geographical state
of the country; and the chief object of interest, which
attracted public embassies and private pilgrims across
the Himalayan mountains, was the religion of Buddha.
About 300 years after the public recognition of Buddhism
by the Emperor Ming-ti, the great stream of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Buddhist pilgrims began to flow from China to India.
The first account which we possess of these pilgrimages
refers to the travels of Fa-hian, who visited India
towards the end of the fourth century. His travels
were translated into French by A. Remusat. After
Fa-hian, we have the travels of Hoei-seng and Song-yun,
who were sent to India, in 518, by command of
the empress, with the view of collecting sacred books
and relics. Then followed Hiouen-thsang, whose life
and travels, from 629-645, have been rendered so
popular by the excellent translation of M. Stanislas
Julien. After Hiouen-thsang the principal works of
Chinese pilgrims are the Itineraries of the Fifty-six
Monks, published in 730, and the travels of Khi-nie,
who visited India in 964, at the head of 300 pilgrims.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the language employed for literary purposes in
India during all this time was Sanskrit, we learn, not
only from the numerous names and religious and philosophical
terms mentioned in the travels of the Chinese
pilgrims, but from a short paradigm of declension and
conjugation in Sanskrit which one of them (Hiouen-thsang)
has inserted in his diary.

Two hundred years more bring us to the reign
of Akbar (1556-1605). A more extraordinary man
never sat on the throne of India. Brought up as a
Muhammedan, he discarded the religion of the Prophet
as superstitious,<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> and then devoted himself to a search
after the true religion. He called Brahmans and fire-worshippers
to his court, and ordered them to discuss
in his presence the merits of their religions with the
Muhammedan doctors. When he heard of the Jesuits
at Goa, he invited them to his capital, and he was for
many years looked upon as a secret convert to Christianity.
He was, however, a rationalist and deist, and
never believed anything, as he declared himself, that
he could not understand. The religion which he founded,
the so-called Ilahi religion, was pure Deism mixed
up with the worship of the sun<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> as the purest and
highest emblem of the Deity. Though Akbar himself
could neither read nor write,<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> his court was the home
of literary men of all persuasions. Whatever book, in
any language, promised to throw light on the problems
nearest to the emperor's heart, he ordered to be translated
into Persian. The New Testament<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> was thus
translated at his command; so were the Mahâbhârata,
the Râmâyaņa, the Amarakosha,<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> and other classical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
works of Sanskrit literature. But though the emperor
set the greatest value on the sacred writings of different
nations, he does not seem to have succeeded in extorting
from the Brahmans a translation of the Veda.
A translation of the Atharva-veda<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> was made for him
by Haji Ibrahim Sirhindi; but that Veda never enjoyed
the same authority as the other three Vedas;
and it is doubtful even whether by Atharva-veda is
meant more than the Upanishads, some of which may
have been composed for the special benefit of Akbar.
There is a story which, though evidently of a legendary
character, shows how the study of Sanskrit was
kept up by the Brahmans during the reign of the Mogul
emperors.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Neither the authority (it is said) nor promises of
Akbar could prevail upon the Brahmans to disclose
the tenets of their religion: he was therefore obliged to
have recourse to artifice. The stratagem he made use
of was to cause an infant, of the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Feizi</span></em>, to be
committed to the care of these priests, as a poor orphan
of the sacerdotal line, who alone could be initiated into
the sacred rites of their theology. Feizi, having received
the proper instructions for the part he was to
act, was conveyed privately to Benares, the seat of
knowledge in Hindostan; he was received into the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house of a learned Brahman, who educated him with
the same care as if he had been his son. After the
youth had spent ten years in study, Akbar was desirous
of recalling him; but he was struck with the charms
of the daughter of his preceptor. The old Brahman
laid no restraint on the growing passion of the two
lovers. He was fond of Feizi, and offered him his
daughter in marriage. The young man, divided between
love and gratitude, resolved to conceal the fraud
no longer, and, falling at the feet of the Brahman,
discovered the imposture, and asked pardon for his offences.
The priest, without reproaching him, seized a
poniard which hung at his girdle, and was going to
plunge it in his heart, if Feizi had not prevented him
by taking hold of his arm. The young man used every
means to pacify him, and declared himself ready to do
anything to expiate his treachery. The Brahman,
bursting into tears, promised to pardon him on condition
that he should swear never to translate the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></em>,
or sacred volumes, or disclose to any person whatever
the symbol of the Brahman creed. Feizi readily promised
him: how far he kept his word is not known;

translated.”</span><a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>

We have thus traced the existence of Sanskrit, as the
language of literature and religion of India, from the
time of Alexander to the reign of Akbar. A hundred
years after Akbar, the eldest son of Shah Jehan, the
unfortunate Dárá, manifested the same interest in religious
speculations which had distinguished his great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grandsire. He became a student of Sanskrit, and
translated the Upanishads, philosophical treatises appended
to the Vedas, into Persian. This was in the
year 1657, a year before he was put to death by
his younger brother, the bigoted Aurengzebe. This
prince's translation was translated into French by Anquetil
Duperron, in the year 1795, the fourth year of
the French Republic; and was for a long time the
principal source from which European scholars derived
their knowledge of the sacred literature of the
Brahmans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the time at which we have now arrived, the
reign of Aurengzebe (1658-1707), the cotemporary
and rival of Louis XIV., the existence of Sanskrit and
Sanskrit literature was known, if not in Europe generally,
at least to Europeans in India, particularly to
missionaries. Who was the first European, that knew
of Sanskrit, or that acquired a knowledge of Sanskrit,
is difficult to say. When Vasco de Gama landed at
Calicut, on the 9th of May, 1498, Padre Pedro began
at once to preach to the natives, and had suffered a
martyr's death before the discoverer of India returned
to Lisbon. Every new ship that reached India brought
new missionaries; but for a long time we look in vain
in their letters and reports for any mention of Sanskrit
or Sanskrit literature. Francis, now St. Francis Xavier,
was the first to organize the great work of preaching
the Gospel in India (1542); and such were his zeal
and devotion, such his success in winning the hearts of
high and low, that his friends ascribed to him, among
other miraculous gifts, the gift of tongues<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>—a gift
never claimed by St. Francis himself. It is not, however,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
till the year 1559 that we first hear of the missionaries
at Goa studying, with the help of a converted
Brahman,<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a>
the theological and philosophical literature
of the country, and challenging the Brahmans to public
disputations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first certain instance of a European missionary
having mastered the difficulties of the Sanskrit language,
belongs to a still later period,—to what may
be called the period of Roberto de Nobili, as distinguished
from the first period, which is under the presiding
spirit of Francis Xavier. Roberto de Nobili
went to India in 1606. He was himself a man of
high family, of a refined and cultivated mind, and he
perceived the more quickly the difficulties which kept
the higher castes, and particularly the Brahmans, from
joining the Christian communities formed at Madura
and other places. These communities consisted chiefly
of men of low rank, of no education, and no refinement.
He conceived the bold plan of presenting himself as a
Brahman, and thus obtaining access to the high and
noble, the wise and learned, in the land. He shut himself
up for years, acquiring in secret a knowledge, not
only of Tamil and Telugu, but of Sanskrit. When, after
a patient study of the language and literature of the
Brahmans, he felt himself strong enough to grapple with
his antagonists, he showed himself in public, dressed in
the proper garb of the Brahmans, wearing their cord
and their frontal mark, observing their diet, and submitting
even to the complicated rules of caste. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was successful, in spite of the persecutions both of the
Brahmans, who were afraid of him, and of his own
fellow-laborers, who could not understand his policy.
His life in India, where he died as an old blind man,
is full of interest to the missionary. I can only speak
of him here as the first European Sanskrit scholar. A
man who could quote from Manu, from the Purâņas,
and even from works such as the Âpastamba-sûtras,
which are known even at present to only those few
Sanskrit scholars who can read Sanskrit MSS., must
have been far advanced in a knowledge of the sacred
language and literature of the Brahmans; and the
very idea that he came, as he said, to preach a new
or a fourth Veda,<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a> which had been lost, shows how
well he knew the strong and weak points of the theological
system which he came to conquer. It is surprising
that the reports which he sent to Rome, in
order to defend himself against the charge of idolatry,
and in which he drew a faithful picture of the religion,
the customs, and literature of the Brahmans, should
not have attracted the attention of scholars. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“Accommodation Question,”</span> as it was called, occupied
cardinals and popes for many years; but not one
of them seems to have perceived the extraordinary

interest attaching to the existence of an ancient civilization
so perfect and so firmly rooted as to require
accommodation even from the missionaries of Rome.
At a time when the discovery of one Greek MS. would
have been hailed by all the scholars of Europe, the
discovery of a complete literature was allowed to pass
unnoticed. The day of Sanskrit had not yet come.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first missionaries who succeeded in rousing the
attention of European scholars to the extraordinary
discovery that had been made were the French Jesuit
missionaries, whom Louis XIV. had sent out to India
after the treaty of Ryswick, in 1697.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> Father Pons
drew up a comprehensive account of the literary treasures
of the Brahmans; and his report, dated Karikal
(dans le Maduré), November 23, 1740, and addressed
to Father Duhalde, was published in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lettres
édifiantes.”</span><a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>
Father Pons gives in it a most interesting
and, in general, a very accurate description of the
various branches of Sanskrit literature,—of the four
Vedas, the grammatical treatises, the six systems of
philosophy, and the astronomy of the Hindus. He
anticipated, on several points, the researches of Sir
William Jones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, although the letter of Father Pons excited a
deep interest, that interest remained necessarily barren,
as long as there were no grammars, dictionaries, and
Sanskrit texts to enable scholars in Europe to study
Sanskrit in the same spirit in which they studied Greek
and Latin. The first who endeavored to supply this
want was a Carmelite friar, a German of the name
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Johann Philip Wesdin, better known as Paulinus
a Santo Bartholomeo. He was in India from 1776 to
1789; and he published the first grammar of Sanskrit
at Rome, in 1790. Although this grammar has been
severely criticised, and is now hardly ever consulted, it
is but fair to bear in mind that the first grammar of
any language is a work of infinitely greater difficulty
than any later grammar.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have thus seen how the existence of the Sanskrit
language and literature was known ever since India
had first been discovered by Alexander and his companions.
But what was not known was, that this language,
as it was spoken at the time of Alexander, and
at the time of Solomon, and for centuries before his
time, was intimately related to Greek and Latin, in
fact, stood to them in the same relation as French
to Italian and Spanish. The history of what may be
called European Sanskrit philology dates from the
foundation of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, in 1784.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>
It was through the labors of Sir William Jones, Carey,
Wilkins, Forster, Colebrooke, and other members of
that illustrious Society, that the language and literature
of the Brahmans became first accessible to European
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scholars; and it would be difficult to say which of
the two, the language or the literature, excited the
deepest and most lasting interest. It was impossible to
look, even in the most cursory manner, at the declensions
and conjugations, without being struck by the
extraordinary similarity, or, in some cases, by the absolute
identity of the grammatical forms in Sanskrit,
Greek, and Latin. As early as 1778, Halhed remarked,
in the preface to his Grammar of Bengalí,<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have been astonished to find this similitude of Sanskrit
words with those of Persian and Arabic, and even
of Latin and Greek; and these not in technical and
metaphorical terms, which the mutuation of refined arts
and improved manners might have occasionally introduced;
but in the main groundwork of language, in
monosyllables, in the names of numbers, and the appellations
of such things as could be first discriminated
on the immediate dawn of civilization.”</span> Sir William
Jones (died 1794), after the first glance at Sanskrit,
declared that whatever its antiquity, it was a language
of most wonderful structure, more perfect than the
Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely
refined than either, yet bearing to both of them
a strong affinity. <span class="tei tei-q">“No philologer,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“could
examine the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, without believing
them to have sprung from some common source,
which, perhaps, no longer exists. There is a similar reason,
though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both
the Gothic and Celtic had the same origin with the Sanskrit.
The old Persian may be added to the same family.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how was that affinity to be explained? People
were completely taken by surprise. Theologians shook
their heads; classical scholars looked sceptical; philosophers
indulged in the wildest conjectures in order to
escape from the only possible conclusion which could
be drawn from the facts placed before them, but which
threatened to upset their little systems of the history of
the world. Lord Monboddo had just finished his great
work<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> in which he derives all mankind from a couple
of apes, and all the dialects of the world from a language
originally framed by some Egyptian gods,<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> when
the discovery of Sanskrit came on him like a thunder-bolt.
It must be said, however, to his credit, that he
at once perceived the immense importance of the discovery.
He could not be expected to sacrifice his primæval
monkeys or his Egyptian idols; but, with that
reservation, the conclusions which he drew from the
new evidence placed before him by his friend Mr. Wilkins,
the author of one of our first Sanskrit grammars,
are highly creditable to the acuteness of the Scotch judge.
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is a language,”</span> he writes<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> (in 1792), <span class="tei tei-q">“still
existing, and preserved among the Bramins of India,
which is a richer and in every respect a finer language
than even the Greek of Homer. All the other languages
of India have a great resemblance to this language,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is called the Shanscrit. But those languages
are dialects of it, and formed from it, not the
Shanscrit from them. Of this, and other particulars
concerning this language, I have got such certain information
from India, that if I live to finish my history
of man, which I have begun in my third volume of
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Antient Metaphysics,’</span> I shall be able clearly to prove
that the Greek is derived from the Shanscrit, which
was the antient language of Egypt, and was carried by
the Egyptians into India, with their other arts, and into
Greece by the colonies which they settled there.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few years later (1795) he had arrived at more
definite views on the relation of Sanskrit to Greek;
and he writes,<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Wilkins has proved to my conviction
such a resemblance betwixt the Greek and the
Shanscrit, that the one must be a dialect of the other,
or both of some original language. Now the Greek
is certainly not a dialect of the Shanscrit, any more
than the Shanscrit is of the Greek. They must,
therefore, be both dialects of the same language; and
that language could be no other than the language
of Egypt, brought into India by Osiris, of which, undoubtedly,
the Greek was a dialect, as I think I have
proved.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Into these theories of Lord Monboddo's on Egypt
and Osiris, we need not inquire at present. But it
may be of interest to give one other extract, in
order to show how well, apart from his men with,
and his monkeys without, tails, Lord Monboddo could
sift and handle the evidence that was placed before
him:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To apply these observations to the similarities which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mr. Wilkins has discovered betwixt the Shanscrit and
the Greek;—I will begin with these words, which must
have been original words in all languages, as the things
denoted by them must have been known in the first
ages of civility, and have got names; so that it is impossible
that one language could have borrowed them
from another, unless it was a derivative or dialect of
that language. Of this kind are the names of numbers,
of the members of the human body, and of relations,
such as that of father, mother, and brother. And first,
as to numbers, the use of which must have been coeval
with civil society. The words in the Shanscrit for the
numbers from one to ten are, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ek</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dwee</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tree</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chatoor</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">panch</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shat</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sapt</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aght</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nava</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">das</span></em>, which certainly have
an affinity to the Greek or Latin names for those numbers.
Then they proceed towards twenty, saying ten
and one, ten and two, and so forth, till they come to
twenty; for their arithmetic is decimal as well as ours.
Twenty they express by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">veensatee</span></em>. Then
they go on till they come to thirty, which they express
by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">treensat</span></em>, of which the word expressing
three is part of the composition, as well as it is of the
Greek and Latin names for those numbers. And in
like manner they go on expressing forty, fifty, &amp;c., by
a like composition with the words expressing simple
numerals, namely, four, five, &amp;c., till they come to the
number one hundred, which they express by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sat</span></em>, a
word different from either the Greek or Latin name for
that number. But, in this numeration, there is a very
remarkable conformity betwixt the word in Shanscrit
expressing twenty or twice ten, and the words in Greek
and Latin expressing the same number; for in none of
the three languages has the word any relation to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
number two, which, by multiplying ten, makes twenty;
such as the words expressing the numbers thirty, forty,
&amp;c., have to the words expressing three or four; for in
Greek the word is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eikosi</span></em>, which expresses no relation
to the number two; nor does the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">viginti</span></em>, but
which appears to have more resemblance to the Shanscrit
word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">veensatee</span></em>. And thus it appears that in the
anomalies of the two languages of Greek and Latin,
there appears to be some conformity with the Shanscrit.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lord Monboddo compares the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pada</span></em> with
the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pous</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">podos</span></em>; the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nâsa</span></em> with the

angle, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kentra</span></em>, for centre, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hora</span></em>, for hour, he points out
as clearly of Greek origin, and imported into Sanskrit.
He then proceeds to show the grammatical
coincidences between Sanskrit and the classical languages.
He dwells on compounds such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tripada</span></em>,
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tri</span></em>, three, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pada</span></em>, foot—a tripod; he remarks
on the extraordinary fact that Sanskrit, like Greek,
changes a positive into a negative adjective by the addition
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> privative; and he then produces what
he seems to consider as the most valuable present that
Mr. Wilkins could have given him, namely, the Sanskrit
forms, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asmi</span></em>, I am; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asi</span></em>, thou art; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asti</span></em>, he is;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">santi</span></em>, they are; forms clearly of the same origin as
the corresponding forms, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esmi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eis</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esti</span></em>, in
Greek, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sunt</span></em> in Latin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another Scotch philosopher, Dugald Stewart, was
much less inclined to yield such ready submission.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
No doubt it must have required a considerable effort
for a man brought up in the belief that Greek and
Latin were either aboriginal languages, or modifications
of Hebrew, to bring himself to acquiesce in the
revolutionary doctrine that the classical languages were
intimately related to a jargon of mere savages; for
such all the subjects of the Great Mogul were then
supposed to be. However, if the facts about Sanskrit
were true, Dugald Stewart was too wise not to see
that the conclusions drawn from them were inevitable.
He therefore denied the reality of such a language
as Sanskrit altogether, and wrote his famous essay to
prove that Sanskrit had been put together, after the
model of Greek and Latin, by those arch-forgers and
liars the Brahmans, and that the whole of Sanskrit
literature was an imposition. I mention this fact, because
it shows, better than anything else, how violent
a shock was given by the discovery of Sanskrit to prejudices
most deeply ingrained in the mind of every
educated man. The most absurd arguments found
favor for a time, if they could only furnish a loophole
by which to escape from the unpleasant conclusion that
Greek and Latin were of the same kith and kin as the
language of the black inhabitants of India. The first
who dared boldly to face both the facts and the conclusions
of Sanskrit scholarship was the German poet,
Frederick Schlegel. He had been in England during
the peace of Amiens (1801-1802), and had learned
a smattering of Sanskrit from Mr. Alexander Hamilton.
After carrying on his studies for some time at
Paris, he published, in 1808, his work, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the
Language and Wisdom of the Indians.”</span> This work
became the foundation of the science of language.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Though published only two years after the first volume
of Adelung's <span class="tei tei-q">“Mithridates,”</span> it is separated from
that work by the same distance which separates the
Copernican from the Ptolemæan system. Schlegel
was not a great scholar. Many of his statements
have proved erroneous; and nothing would be easier
than to dissect his essay and hold it up to ridicule.
But Schlegel was a man of genius; and when a new
science is to be created, the imagination of the poet is
wanted, even more than the accuracy of the scholar.
It surely required somewhat of poetic vision to embrace
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> glance the languages of India, Persia,
Greece, Italy, and Germany, and to rivet them together
by the simple name of Indo-Germanic. This
was Schlegel's work; and in the history of the intellect,
it has truly been called <span class="tei tei-q">“the discovery of a new
world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall see, in our next lecture, how Schlegel's
idea was taken up in Germany, and how it led almost
immediately to a genealogical classification of the principal
languages of mankind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We traced, in our last Lecture, the history of the
various attempts at a classification of languages to the
year 1808, the year in which Frederick Schlegel published
his little work on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Language and Wisdom
of the Indians.”</span> This work was like the wand of a
magician. It pointed out the place where a mine
should be opened; and it was not long before some
of the most distinguished scholars of the day began to
sink their shafts, and raise the ore. For a time, everybody
who wished to learn Sanskrit had to come to
England. Bopp, Schlegel, Lassen, Rosen, Burnouf,
all spent some time in this country, copying manuscripts
at the East-India House, and receiving assistance
from Wilkins, Colebrooke, Wilson, and other distinguished
members of the old Indian Civil Service.
The first minute and scholar-like comparison of the
grammar of Sanskrit with that of Greek and Latin,
Persian, and German, was made by Francis Bopp, in
1816.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a> Other essays of his followed; and in 1833
appeared the first volume of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Grammar
of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian,
Slavonic, Gothic, and German.”</span> This work was not
finished till nearly twenty years later, in
1852;<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> but it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will form forever the safe and solid foundation of comparative
philology. August Wilhelm von Schlegel,
the brother of Frederick Schlegel, used the influence
which he had acquired as a German poet, to popularize
the study of Sanskrit in Germany. His <span class="tei tei-q">“Indische
Bibliothek”</span> was published from 1819 to 1830, and
though chiefly intended for Sanskrit literature, it likewise
contained several articles on Comparative Philology.
This new science soon found a still more
powerful patron in William von Humboldt, the worthy
brother of Alexander von Humboldt, and at that time
one of the leading statesmen in Prussia. His essays,
chiefly on the philosophy of language, attracted general
attention during his lifetime; and he left a lasting
monument of his studies in his great work on the
Kawi language, which was published after his death,
in 1836. Another scholar who must be reckoned
among the founders of Comparative Philology is Professor
Pott, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“Etymological Researches”</span> appeared
first in 1833 and 1836.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> More special in its
purpose, but based on the same general principles, was
Grimm's <span class="tei tei-q">“Teutonic Grammar,”</span> a work which has
truly been called colossal. Its publication occupied
nearly twenty years, from 1819 to 1837. We ought,
likewise, to mention here the name of an eminent Dane,
Erasmus Rask, who devoted himself to the study of the
northern languages of Europe. He started, in 1816, for
Persia and India, and was the first to acquire a knowledge
of Zend, the language of the Zend-Avesta; but he
died before he had time to publish all the results of his
learned researches. He had proved, however, that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sacred language of the Parsis was closely connected
with the sacred language of the Brahmans, and that,
like Sanskrit, it had preserved some of the earliest formations
of Indo-European speech. These researches
into the ancient Persian language were taken up again
by one of the greatest scholars that France ever produced,
by Eugène Burnouf. Though the works of
Zoroaster had been translated before by Anquetil Duperron,
his was only a translation of a modern Persian
translation of the original. It was Burnouf who, by
means of his knowledge of Sanskrit and Comparative
Grammar, deciphered for the first time the very words
of the founder of the ancient religion of light. He
was, likewise, the first to apply the same key with
real success to the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius
and Xerxes; and his premature death will long be
mourned, not only by those who, like myself, had the
privilege of knowing him personally and attending his
lectures, but by all who have the interest of oriental
literature and of real oriental scholarship at heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot give here a list of all the scholars who
followed in the track of Bopp, Schlegel, Humboldt,
Grimm, and Burnouf. How the science of language
has flourished and abounded may best be seen in the
library of any comparative philologist. There has been
for the last ten years a special journal of Comparative
Philology in Germany. The Philological Society in
London publishes every year a valuable volume of its
transactions; and in almost every continental university
there is a professor of Sanskrit who lectures
likewise on Comparative Grammar and the science
of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But why, it may naturally be asked, why should the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discovery of Sanskrit have wrought so complete a
change in the classificatory study of languages? If
Sanskrit had been the primitive language of mankind,
or at least the parent of Greek, Latin, and German,
we might understand that it should have led to quite a
new classification of these tongues. But Sanskrit does
not stand to Greek, Latin, the Teutonic, Celtic, and
Slavonic languages in the relation of Latin to French,
Italian, and Spanish. Sanskrit, as we saw before,
could not be called their parent, but only their elder
sister. It occupies with regard to the classical languages
a position analogous to that which Provençal
occupies with regard to the modern Romance dialects.
This is perfectly true; but it was exactly this necessity
of determining distinctly and accurately the mutual
relation of Sanskrit and the other members of the same
family of speech, which led to such important results,
and particularly to the establishment of the laws of phonetic
change as the only safe means for measuring the
various degrees of relationship of cognate dialects, and
thus restoring the genealogical tree of human speech.
When Sanskrit had once assumed its right position,
when people had once become familiarized with the
idea that there must have existed a language more
primitive than Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, and forming
the common background of these three, as well as
of the Teutonic, Celtic, and Slavonic branches of
speech, all languages seemed to fall by themselves into
their right position. The key of the puzzle was found,
and all the rest was merely a work of patience. The
same arguments by which Sanskrit and Greek had
been proved to hold co-ordinate rank were perceived to
apply with equal strength to Latin and Greek; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after Latin had once been shown to be more primitive
on many points than Greek, it was easy to see that the
Teutonic, the Celtic, and the Slavonic languages also,
contained each a number of formations which it was
impossible to derive from Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin.
It was perceived that all had to be treated as co-ordinate
members of one and the same class.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first great step in advance, therefore, which was
made in the classification of languages, chiefly through
the discovery of Sanskrit, was this, that scholars were
no longer satisfied with the idea of a general relationship,
but began to inquire for the different degrees of
relationship in which each member of a class stood to
another. Instead of mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classes</span></em>, we hear now for the
first time of well regulated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">families</span></em> of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A second step in advance followed naturally from
the first. Whereas, for establishing in a general way
the common origin of certain languages, a comparison
of numerals, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and the
most essential nouns and verbs, had been sufficient, it
was soon found that a more accurate standard was
required for measuring the more minute degrees of
relationship. Such a standard was supplied by Comparative
Grammar; that is to say, by an intercomparison
of the grammatical forms of languages supposed to
be related to each other; such intercomparison being
carried out according to certain laws which regulate
the phonetic changes of letters.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A glance at the modern history of language will
make this clearer. There could never be any doubt
that the so-called Romance languages, Italian, Wallachian,
Provençal, French, Spanish, and Portuguese,
were closely related to each other. Everybody could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
see that they were all derived from Latin. But
one of the most distinguished French scholars, Raynouard,
who has done more for the history of the Romance
languages and literature than any one else,
maintained that Provençal only was the daughter of
Latin; whereas French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese
were the daughters of Provençal. He maintained
that Latin passed, from the seventh to the ninth
century, through an intermediate stage, which he called
Langue Romane, and which he endeavored to prove
was the same as the Provençal of Southern France,
the language of the Troubadours. According to him,
it was only after Latin had passed through this uniform
metamorphosis, represented by the Langue Romane or
Provençal, that it became broken up into the various
Romance dialects of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal.
This theory, which was vigorously attacked by
August Wilhelm von Schlegel, and afterwards minutely
criticised by Sir Cornewall Lewis, can only be refuted
by a comparison of the Provençal grammar with that
of the other Romance dialects. And here, if you take
the auxiliary verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to be</span></em>, and compare its forms in Provençal
and French, you will see at once that, on several
points, French has preserved the original Latin
forms in a more primitive state than Provençal, and
that, therefore, it is impossible to classify French as the
daughter of Provençal, and as the granddaughter of
Latin. We have in Provençal:—

Pelasgic stage, but that both are independent modifications

Latin is less primitive than Greek; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sum</span></em>

more primitive than Greek. The regular form would
be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as-anti</span></em>; this, in Sanskrit, is changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">santi</span></em>. In
Greek, the initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> is dropped, and the Æolic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enti</span></em>, is
finally reduced to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eisi</span></em>. The Latin, on the contrary,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By applying this test to all languages, the founders
of comparative philology soon reduced the principal
dialects of Europe and Asia to certain families, and
they were able in each family to distinguish different
branches, each consisting again of numerous dialects,
both ancient and modern.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many languages, however, which as yet
have not been reduced to families, and though there
is no reason to doubt that some of them will hereafter
be comprehended in a system of genealogical
classification, it is right to guard from the beginning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against the common, but altogether gratuitous supposition,
that the principle of genealogical classification
must be applicable to all. Genealogical classification
is no doubt the most perfect of all classifications, but
there are but few branches of physical science in
which it can be carried out, except very partially.
In the science of language, genealogical classification
must rest chiefly on the formal or grammatical elements,
which, after they have been affected by phonetic
change, can be kept up only by a continuous
tradition. We know that French, Italian, Spanish,
and Portuguese must be derived from a common
source, because they share grammatical forms in common,
which none of these dialects could have supplied
from their own resources, and which have no meaning,
or, so to say, no life, in any one of them. The termination
of the imperfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ba</span></em> in Spanish, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">va</span></em> in Italian, by
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canto</span></em>, I sing, is changed into
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cantaba</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cantava</span></em>,
has no separate existence, and no independent
meaning in either of these modern dialects. It could
not have been formed with the materials supplied by
Spanish and Italian. It must have been handed
down from an earlier generation in which this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ba</span></em>
had a meaning. We trace it back to Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bam</span></em>, in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cantabam</span></em>, and here it can be proved that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bam</span></em> was originally
an independent auxiliary verb, the same which
exists in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bhavâmi</span></em>, and in the Anglo-Saxon
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beom</span></em>, I am. Genealogical classification, therefore,
applies properly only to decaying languages, to languages
in which grammatical growth has been arrested,
through the influence of literary cultivation; in
which little new is added, everything old is retained
as long as possible, and where what we call growth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or history is nothing but the progress of phonetic corruption.
But before languages decay, they have passed
through a period of growth; and it seems to have been
completely overlooked, that dialects which diverged
during that early period, would naturally resist every
attempt at genealogical classification. If you remember
the manner in which, for instance, the plural was
formed in Chinese and other languages examined by
us in a former Lecture, you will see that where each
dialect may choose its own term expressive of plurality,
such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heap</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">class</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kind</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">flock</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cloud</span></em>, &amp;c., it would be
unreasonable to expect similarity in grammatical terminations,
after these terms have been ground down
by phonetic corruption to mere exponents of plurality.
But, on the other hand, it would by no means follow
that therefore these languages had no common origin.
Languages may have a common origin, and yet the
words which they originally employed for marking
case, number, person, tense, and mood, having been
totally different, the grammatical terminations to which
these words would gradually dwindle down could not
possibly yield any results if submitted to the analysis
of comparative grammar. A genealogical classification
of such languages is, therefore, from the nature of the
case, simply impossible, at least, if such classification
is chiefly to be based on grammatical or formal
evidence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It might be supposed, however, that such languages,
though differing in their grammatical articulation, would
yet evince their common origin by the identity of their
radicals or roots. No doubt, they will in many instances.
They will probably have retained their numerals
in common, some of their pronouns, and some of the
commonest words of every-day life. But even here we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must not expect too much, nor be surprised if we find
even less than we expected. You remember how the
names for father varied in the numerous Friesian dialects.
Instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frater</span></em>, the Latin word for brother,
you find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hermano</span></em> in Spanish. Instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ignis</span></em>, the
Latin word for fire, you have in French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em>, in Italian,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fuoco</span></em>. Nobody would doubt the common origin of
German and English; yet the English numeral <span class="tei tei-q">“the
first,”</span> though preserved in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fürst</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prïnceps</span></em>, prince,
is quite different from the German <span class="tei tei-q">“Der Erste;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“the second”</span> is quite different from <span class="tei tei-q">“Der Zweite;”</span>
and there is no connection between the possessive pronoun
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em>, and the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sein</span></em>. This dialectical freedom
works on a much larger scale in ancient and illiterate
languages; and those who have most carefully
watched the natural growth of dialects will be the least
surprised that dialects which had the same origin should
differ, not only in their grammatical framework, but
likewise in many of those test-words which are very
properly used for discovering the relationship of literary
languages. How it is possible to say anything
about the relationship of such dialects we shall see
hereafter. For the present, it is sufficient if I have
made it clear why the principle of genealogical classification
is not of necessity applicable to all languages;
and secondly, why languages, though they cannot be
classified genealogically, need not therefore be supposed
to have been different from the beginning. The assertion
so frequently repeated that the impossibility of
classing all languages genealogically proves the impossibility
of a common origin of language, is nothing
but a kind of scientific dogmatism, which, more
than anything else, has impeded the free progress of
independent research.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But let us see now how far the genealogical classification
of languages has advanced, how many families
of human speech have been satisfactorily established.
Let us remember what suggested to us the necessity of
a genealogical classification. We wished to know the
original intention of certain words and grammatical
forms in English, and we saw that before we could
attempt to fathom the origin of such words as <span class="tei tei-q">“I
love,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“I loved,”</span> we should have to trace them
back to their most primitive state. We likewise found,
by a reference to the history of the Romance dialects,
that words existing in one dialect had frequently been
preserved in a more primitive form in another, and that,
therefore, it was of the highest importance to bring ancient
languages into the same genealogical connection
by which French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese are
held together as the members of one family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beginning, therefore, with the living language of
England, we traced it, without difficulty, to Anglo-Saxon.
This carries us back to the seventh century
after Christ, for it is to that date that Kemble and
Thorpe refer the ancient English epic, the Beowulf.
Beyond this we cannot go on English soil. But we
know that the Saxons, the Angles, and Jutes came
from the continent, and there their descendants, along
the northern coast of Germany, still speak <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Low-German</span></em>,
or Nieder-Deutsch, which in the harbors of Antwerp,
Bremen, and Hamburg, has been mistaken by
many an English sailor for a corrupt English dialect.
The Low-German comprehends many dialects in the
north or the lowlands of Germany; but in Germany
proper they are hardly ever used for literary purposes.
The Friesian dialects are Low-German, so are the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dutch and Flemish. The Friesian had a literature
of its own as early at least as the twelfth century,
if not earlier.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> The Dutch, which is still a national
and literary language, though confined to a small area,
can be traced back to literary documents of the sixteenth
century. The Flemish, too, was at that time
the language of the court of Flanders and Brabant,
but has since been considerably encroached upon,
though not yet extinguished, by the official languages
of the kingdoms of Holland and Belgium. The oldest
literary document of Low-German on the Continent is
the Christian epic, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heljand</span></span> (Heljand = Heiland,
the Healer or Saviour), which is preserved to us in
two MSS. of the ninth century, and was written at
that time for the benefit of the newly converted Saxons.
We have traces of a certain amount of literature
in Saxon or Low-German from that time onward
through the Middle Ages up to the seventeenth century.
But little only of that literature has been
preserved; and, after the translation of the Bible by
Luther into High-German, the fate of Low-German
literature was sealed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The literary language of Germany is, and has been
ever since the days of Charlemagne, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">High-German</span></em>.
It is spoken in various dialects all over Germany.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Its history may be traced through three periods.
The present, or New High-German period dates from
Luther; the Middle High-German period extends
from Luther backwards to the twelfth century; the
Old High-German period extends from thence to the
seventh century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see that we can follow the High-German,
as well as the Low-German branch of Teutonic speech,
back to about the seventh century after Christ. We
must not suppose that before that time there was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
common Teutonic language spoken by all German
tribes, and that it afterwards diverged into two streams,—the
High and Low. There never was a common,
uniform, Teutonic language; nor is there any evidence
to show that there existed at any time a uniform High-German
or Low-German language, from which all
High-German and Low-German dialects are respectively
derived. We cannot derive Anglo-Saxon, Friesian,
Flemish, Dutch, and Platt-Deutsch from the ancient
Low-German, which is preserved in the continental
Saxon of the ninth century. All we can say is this,
that these various Low-German dialects in England,
Holland, Friesia, and Lower Germany, passed at different
times through the same stages, or, so to say, the
same latitudes of grammatical growth. We may add
that, with every century that we go back, the convergence
of these dialects becomes more and more decided;
but there is no evidence to justify us in admitting the
historical reality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> primitive and uniform Low-German
language from which they were all derived. This
is a mere creation of grammarians who cannot understand
a multiplicity of dialects without a common type.
They would likewise demand the admission of a primitive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
High-German language, as the source, not only of
the literary Old, Middle, and Modern High-German,
but likewise of all the local dialects of Austria, Bavaria,
Swabia, and Franconia. And they would wish us
to believe that, previous to the separation into High
and Low German, there existed one complete Teutonic
language, as yet neither High nor Low, but containing
the germs of both. Such a system may be convenient
for the purposes of grammatical analysis, but it becomes
mischievous as soon as these grammatical abstractions
are invested with an historical reality. As there
were families, clans, confederacies, and tribes, before
there was a nation; so there were dialects before there
was a language. The grammarian who postulates an
historical reality for the one primitive type of Teutonic
speech, is no better than the historian who believes in
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Francus</span></em>, the grandson of Hector, and the supposed
ancestor of all the Franks, or in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></em>, the mythical
father of all the Britons. When the German races
descended, one after the other, from the Danube and
from the Baltic, to take possession of Italy and the
Roman provinces,—when the Goths, the Lombards,
the Vandals, the Franks, the Burgundians, each under
their own kings, and with their own laws and customs,
settled in Italy, Gaul, and Spain, to act their
several parts in the last scene of the Roman tragedy,—we
have no reason to suppose that they all spoke
one and the same dialect. If we possessed any literary
documents of those ancient German races, we
should find them all dialects again, some with the
peculiarities of High, others with those of Low, German.
Nor is this mere conjecture: for it so happens
that, by some fortunate accident, the dialect of one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at least of those ancient German races has been preserved
to us in the Gothic translation of the Bible by
Bishop Ulfilas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must say a few words on this remarkable man.
The accounts of ecclesiastical historians with regard
to the date and the principal events in the life of
Ulfilas are very contradictory. This is partly owing
to the fact that Ulfilas was an Arian bishop, and that
the accounts which we possess of him come from two
opposite sides, from Arian and Athanasian writers.
Although in forming an estimate of his character it
would be necessary to sift this contradictory evidence,
it is but fair to suppose that, when dates and simple
facts in the life of the Bishop have to be settled, his
own friends had better means of information than the
orthodox historians. It is, therefore, from the writings
of his own co-religionists that the chronology and the
historical outline of the Bishop's life should be determined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal writers to be consulted are Philostorgius,
as preserved by Photius, and Auxentius, as
preserved by Maximinus in a MS. lately discovered
by Professor Waitz<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>
in the Library at Paris. (Supplement.
Latin. No. 594.) This MS. contains some
writings of Hilarius, the two first books of Ambrosius
De fide, and the acts of the Council of Aquileja (381).
On the margin of this MS. Maximinus repeated the
beginning of the acts of the Council of Aquileja, adding
remarks of his own in order to show how unfairly
Palladius had been treated in that council by Ambrose.
He jotted down his own views on the Arian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
controversy, and on fol. 282, seq., he copied an account
of Ulfilas written by Auxentius, the bishop of
Dorostorum (Silistria on the Danube), a pupil of
Ulfilas. This is followed again by some dissertations
of Maximinus, and on foll. 314-327, a treatise addressed
to Ambrose by a Semi-arian, a follower of
Eusebius, possibly by Prudentius himself, was copied
and slightly abbreviated for his own purposes by
Maximinus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is from Auxentius, as copied by Maximinus, that
we learn that Ulfilas died at Constantinople, where he
had been invited by the emperor to a disputation.
This could not have been later than the year 381,
because, according to the same Auxentius, Ulfilas had
been bishop for forty years, and, according to Philostorgius,
he had been consecrated by Eusebius. Now
Eusebius of Nicomedia died 341, and as Philostorgius
says that Ulfilas was consecrated by <span class="tei tei-q">“Eusebius and
the bishops who were with him,”</span> the consecration has
been referred with great plausibility to the beginning
of the year 341, when Eusebius presided at the Synod
of Antioch. As Ulfilas was thirty years old at the
time of his consecration, he must have been born in
311, and as he was seventy years of age when he died
at Constantinople, his death must have taken place in
381.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Professor Waitz fixed the death of Ulfilas in 388,
because it is stated by Auxentius that other Arian
bishops had come with Ulfilas on his last journey to
Constantinople, and had actually obtained the promise
of a new council from the emperors, but that the
heretical party, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Athanasians, succeeded in
getting a law published, prohibiting all disputation on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the faith, whether in public or private. Maximinus,
to whom we owe this notice, has added two laws from
the Codex Theodosianus, which he supposed to have
reference to this controversy, dated respectively 388
and 386. This shows that Maximinus himself was
doubtful as to the exact date. Neither of these laws,
however, is applicable to the case, as has been fully
shown by Dr. Bessell. They are quotations from the
Codex Theodosianus made by Maximinus at his own
risk, and made in error. If the death of Ulfilas were
fixed in 388, the important notice of Philostorgius,
that Ulfilas was consecrated by Eusebius, would have
to be surrendered, and we should have to suppose that
as late as 388 Theodosius had been in treaty with the
Arians, whereas after the year 383, when the last
attempt at a reconciliation bad been made by Theodosius,
and had failed, no mercy was any longer shown
to the party of Ulfilas and his friends.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, on the contrary, Ulfilas died at Constantinople
in 381, he might well have been called there by the
Emperor Theodosius, not to a council, but to a disputation
(ad disputationem), as Dr. Bessell ingeniously
maintains, against the Psathyropolistæ,<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> a new sect of
Arians at Constantinople. About the same time, in
380, Sozomen<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> refers to efforts made by the Arians to
gain influence with Theodosius. He mentions, like
Auxentius, that these efforts were defeated, and a law
published to forbid disputations on the nature of God.
This law exists in the Codex Theodosianus, and is
dated January 10, 381. But what is most important
is, that this law actually revokes a rescript that had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been obtained fraudulently by the Arian heretics, thus
confirming the statement of Auxentius that the emperor
had held out to him and his party a promise of
a new council.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now return to Ulfilas. He was born in 311.
His parents, as Philostorgius tells us, were of Cappadocian
origin, and had been carried away by the Goths
as captives from a place called Sadagolthina, near the
town of Parnassus. It was under Valerian and Gallienus
(about 267) that the Goths made this raid from
Europe to Asia, Galatia, and Cappadocia, and the
Christian captives whom they carried back to the
Danube were the first to spread the light of the Gospel
among the Goths. Philostorgius was himself a
Cappadocian, and there is no reason to doubt this
statement of his on the parentage of Ulfilas. Ulfilas
was born among the Goths; Gothic was his native
language, though he was able in after-life to speak and
write both in Latin and Greek. Philostorgius, after
speaking of the death of Crispus (326), and before
proceeding to the last years of Constantine, says, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“about that time”</span> Ulfilas led his Goths from beyond
the Danube into the Roman empire. They had to
leave their country, being persecuted on account of
their Christianity. Ulfilas was the leader of the faithful
flock, and came to Constantine, (not Constantius,)
as ambassador. This must have been before 337, the
year of Constantine's death. It may have been in
328, when Constantine had gained a victory over the
Goths; and though Ulfilas was then only seventeen
years of age, this would be no reason for rejecting the
testimony of Philostorgius, who says that Constantine
treated Ulfilas with great respect, and called him the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Moses of his time. Having led his faithful flock
across the Danube into Mœsia, he might well have
been compared by the emperor to Moses leading the
Israelites from Egypt through the Red Sea. It is true
that Auxentius institutes the same comparison between
Ulfilas and Moses, after stating that Ulfilas had been
received with great honors by Constantius. But this
refers to what took place after Ulfilas had been for
seven years bishop among the Goths, in 348, and does
not invalidate the statement of Philostorgius as to the
earlier intercourse between Ulfilas and Constantine.
Sozomen (H. E. vi. 3, 7) clearly distinguishes between
the first crossing of the Danube by the Goths,
with Ulfilas as their ambassador, and the later attacks
of Athanarich on Fridigern or Fritiger, which led to
the settlement of the Goths in the Roman empire. We
must suppose that after having crossed the Danube,
Ulfilas remained for some time with his Goths, or at
Constantinople. Auxentius says that he officiated as
Lector, and it was only when he had reached the
requisite age of thirty, that he was made bishop by
Eusebius in 341. He passed the first seven years of
his episcopate among the Goths, and the remaining
thirty-three of his life <span class="tei tei-q">“in solo Romaniæ,”</span> where he
had migrated together with Fritiger and the Thervingi.
There is some confusion as to the exact date
of the Gothic Exodus, but it is not at all unlikely
that Ulfilas acted as their leader on more than one
occasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is little more to be learnt about Ulfilas from
other sources. What is said by ecclesiastical historians
about the motives of his adopting the doctrines of
Arius, and his changing from one side to the other,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deserves no credit. Ulfilas, according to his own confession,
was always an Arian (semper sic credidi).
Socrates says that Ulfilas was present at the Synod
of Constantinople in 360, which may be true, though
neither Auxentius nor Philostorgius mentions it. The
author of the Acts of Nicetas speaks of Ulfilas as
present at the Council of Nicæa, in company with
Theophilus. Theophilus, it is true, signed his name
as a Gothic bishop at that council, but there is nothing
to confirm the statement that Ulfilas, then fourteen
years of age, was with Theophilus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ulfilas translated the whole Bible, except the Books
of Kings. For the Old Testament he used the Septuagint;
for the New, the Greek text; but not exactly
in that form in which we have it. Unfortunately, the
greater part of his work has been lost, and we have
only considerable portions of the Gospels, all the genuine
Epistles of St. Paul, though again not complete;
fragments of a Psalm, of Ezra, and Nehemiah.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though Ulfilas belonged to the western Goths, his
translation was used by all Gothic tribes, when they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
advanced into Spain and Italy. The Gothic language
died out in the ninth century, and after the extinction
of the great Gothic empires, the translation of Ulfilas
was lost and forgotten. But a MS. of the fifth century
had been preserved in the Abbey of Werden, and
towards the end of the sixteenth century, a man of the
name of Arnold Mercator, who was in the service of
William IV., the Landgrave of Hessia, drew attention
to this old parchment containing large fragments of the
translation of Ulfilas. The MS., known as the Codex
Argenteus, was afterwards transferred to Prague, and
when Prague was taken in 1648 by Count Königsmark,
he carried this Codex to Upsala in Sweden, where it is
still preserved as one of the greatest treasures. The
parchment is purple, the letters in silver, and the MS.
bound in solid silver.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1818, Cardinal Mai and Count Castiglione discovered
some more fragments in the Monastery of
Bobbio, where they had probably been preserved ever
since the Gothic empire of Theodoric the Great in Italy
had been destroyed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ulfilas must have been a man of extraordinary power
to conceive, for the first time, the idea of translating the
Bible into the vulgar language of his people. At his
time, there existed in Europe but two languages which
a Christian bishop would have thought himself justified
in employing, Greek and Latin. All other languages
were still considered as barbarous. It required a prophetic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sight, and a faith in the destinies of these half-savage
tribes, and a conviction also of the utter effeteness
of the Roman and Byzantine empires, before a bishop
could have brought himself to translate the Bible into
the vulgar dialect of his barbarous countrymen. Soon
after the death of Ulfilas, the number of Christian
Goths at Constantinople had so much increased as to
induce Chrysostom, the bishop of Constantinople (397-405),
to establish a church in the capital, where the
service was to be read in Gothic.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The language of Ulfilas, the Gothic, belongs, through
its phonetic structure, to the Low-German class, but in
its grammar it is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with few exceptions</span></em>, far more primitive
than the Anglo-Saxon of the Beowulf, or the Old High-German
of Charlemagne. These few exceptions, however,
are very important, for they show that it would
be grammatically, and therefore historically, impossible
to derive either Anglo-Saxon or High-German, or both,<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
from Gothic. It would be impossible, for instance, to
treat the first person plural of the indicative present, the
Old High-German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nerjamês</span></em>, as a corruption of the
Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nasjam</span></em>; for we know, from the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">masi</span></em>,
the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mes</span></em>, the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mus</span></em>, that this was the original
termination of the first person plural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Gothic is but one of the numerous dialects of the
German race; some of which became the feeders of the
literary languages of the British Isles, of Holland,
Friesia, and of Low and High Germany, while others
became extinct, and others rolled on from century to
century unheeded, and without ever producing any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
literature at all. It is because Gothic is the only one
of these parallel dialects that can be traced back to the
fourth century, whereas the others disappear from our
sight in the seventh, that it has been mistaken by some
for the original source of all Teutonic speech. The
same arguments, however, which we used against Raynouard,
to show that Provençal could not be considered
as the parent of the Six Romance dialects, would tell
with equal force against the pretensions of Gothic to be
considered as more than the eldest sister of the Teutonic
branch of speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, in fact, a third stream of Teutonic speech,
which asserts its independence as much as High-German
and Low-German, and which it would be impossible
to place in any but a co-ordinate position with
regard to Gothic, Low and High German. This is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scandinavian</span></em> branch. It consists at present of three
literary dialects, those of Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland,
and of various local dialects, particularly in secluded
valleys and fiords of Norway,<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> where, however,
the literary language is Danish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is commonly supposed<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>
that, as late as the eleventh
century, identically the same language was spoken in
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and that this language
was preserved almost intact in Iceland, while in Sweden
and Denmark it grew into two new national dialects.
Nor is there any doubt that the Icelandic skald recited
his poems in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, nay,
even among his countrymen in England and Gardariki,
without fear of not being understood, till, as it is said,
William introduced Welsh, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> French, into England,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Slavonic tongues grew up in the east.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> But though
one and the same language (then called Danish or Norrænish)
was understood, I doubt whether one and the
same language was spoken by all Northmen, and whether
the first germs of Swedish and Danish did not exist long
before the eleventh century, in the dialects of the numerous
clans and tribes of the Scandinavian race. That
race is clearly divided into two branches, called by
Swedish scholars the East and West Scandinavian.
The former would be represented by the old language
of Norway and Iceland, the latter by Swedish and
Danish. This division of the Scandinavian race had
taken place before the Northmen settled in Sweden and
Norway. The western division migrated westward from
Russia, and crossed over from the continent to the
Aland Islands, and from thence to the southern coast of
the peninsula. The eastern division travelled along
the Bothnian Gulf, passing the country occupied by the
Finns and Lapps, and settled in the northern highlands,
spreading toward the south and west.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest fragments of Scandinavian speech are
preserved in the two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eddas</span></span>, the elder or poetical Edda,
containing old mythic poems, the younger or Snorri's
Edda giving an account of the ancient mythology in
prose. Both Eddas were composed, not in Norway,
but in Iceland, an island about as large as Ireland, and
which became first known through some Irish monks
who settled there in the eighth century.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> In the ninth
century voyages of discovery were made to Iceland by
Naddodd, Gardar, and Flokki, 860-870, and soon after
the distant island, distant about 750 English miles from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Norway, became a kind of America to the Puritans and
Republicans of the Scandinavian peninsula. Harald
Haarfagr (850-933) had conquered most of the Norwegian
kings, and his despotic sway tended to reduce the
northern freemen to a state of vassalage. Those who
could not resist, and could not bring themselves to yield
to the sceptre of Harald, left their country and migrated
to France, to England, and to Iceland (874). They
were mostly nobles and freemen, and they soon established
in Iceland an aristocratic republic, such as they
had had in Norway before the days of Harald. This
northern republic flourished; it adopted Christianity in
the year 1000. Schools were founded, two bishoprics
were established, and classical literature was studied
with the same zeal with which their own national poems
and laws had been collected and interpreted by native
scholars and historians. The Icelanders were famous
travellers, and the names of Icelandic students are found
not only in the chief cities of Europe, but in the holy
places of the East. At the beginning of the twelfth
century Iceland counted 50,000 inhabitants. Their intellectual
and literary activity lasted to the beginning
of the thirteenth century, when the island was conquered
by Hakon VI., king of Norway. In 1380, Norway,
together with Iceland, was united with Denmark;
and when, in 1814, Norway was ceded to Sweden, Iceland
remained, as it is still, under Danish sway.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old poetry which flourished in Norway in the
eighth century, and which was cultivated by the skalds
in the ninth, would have been lost in Norway itself had
it not been for the jealous care with which it was preserved
by the emigrants of Iceland. The most important
branch of their traditional poetry were short
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
songs (hliod or Quida), relating the deeds of their gods
and heroes. It is impossible to determine their age,
but they existed at least previous to the migration of
the Northmen to Iceland, and probably as early as the
seventh century, the same century which yields the
oldest remnants of Anglo-Saxon, Low-German, and
High-German. They were collected in the middle
of the twelfth century by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saemund Sigfusson</span></span> (died
1133). In 1643 a similar collection was discovered
in MSS. of the thirteenth century, and published under
the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edda</span></span>, or Great-Grandmother. This
collection is called the old or poetic Edda, in order
to distinguish it from a later work ascribed to Snorri
Sturluson (died 1241). This, the younger or prose
Edda, consists of three parts: the mocking of Gylfi,
the speeches of Bragi, and the Skalda, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ars poetica</span></span>.
Snorri Sturluson has been called the Herodotus of
Iceland; and his chief work is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heimskringla,”</span>
the world-ring, which contains the northern history
from the mythic times to the time of King Magnus
Erlingsson (died 1177). It was probably in preparing
his history that, like Cassiodorus, Saxo Grammaticus,
Paulus Diaconus, and other historians of the same
class, Snorri collected the old songs of the people; for
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Edda,”</span> and particularly his <span class="tei tei-q">“Skalda,”</span> are full
of ancient poetic fragments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Skalda,”</span> and the rules which it contains,
represent the state of poetry in the thirteenth century;
and nothing can be more artificial, nothing
more different from the genuine poetry of the old
<span class="tei tei-q">“Edda”</span> than this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ars poetica</span></span> of Snorri Sturluson.
One of the chief features of this artificial or skaldic
poetry was this, that nothing should be called by its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proper name. A ship was not to be called a ship,
but the beast of the sea; blood, not blood, but the
dew of pain, or the water of the sword. A warrior
was not spoken of as a warrior, but as an armed tree,
the tree of battle. A sword was the flame of wounds.
In this poetical language, which every skald was bound
to speak, there were no less than 115 names for Odin;
an island could be called by 120 synonymous titles.
The specimens of ancient poetry which Snorri quotes
are taken from the skalds, whose names are well
known in history, and who lived from the tenth to
the thirteenth century. But he never quotes from
any song contained in the old <span class="tei tei-q">“Edda,”</span><a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> whether it
be that those songs were considered by himself as
belonging to a different and much more ancient period
of literature, or that they could not be used in illustration
of the scholastic rules of skaldic poets, these
very rules being put to shame by the simple style of
the national poetry, which expressed what it had to
express without effort and circumlocution.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have thus traced the modern Teutonic dialects
back to four principal channels,—the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">High-German</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Low-German</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gothic</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scandinavian</span></em>; and we have
seen that these four, together with several minor dialects,
must be placed in a co-ordinate position from
the beginning, as so many varieties of Teutonic speech.
This Teutonic speech may, for convenience' sake, be
spoken of as one,—as one branch of that great family
of language to which, as we shall see, it belongs; but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it should always be borne in mind that this primitive
and uniform language never had any real historical
existence, and that, like all other languages, that of
the Germans began with dialects which gradually
formed themselves into several distinct national deposits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must now advance more rapidly, and, instead
of the minuteness of an Ordnance-map, we must be
satisfied with the broad outlines of Wyld's Great Globe
in our survey of the languages which, together with the
Teutonic, form the Indo-European or Aryan family of
speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And first the Romance, or modern Latin languages.
Leaving mere local dialects out of sight, we have at
present six literary modifications of Latin, or more
correctly, of ancient Italian,—the languages of Portugal,
of Spain, of France, of Italy, of Wallachia,<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Grisons of Switzerland, called the Roumansch
or Romanese.<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> The Provençal, which, in the poetry
of the Troubadours, attained at a very early time to a
high literary excellence, has now sunk down to a mere
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patois</span></span>. The earliest Provençal poem, the Song of
Boëthius, is generally referred to the tenth century:
Le Bœuf referred it to the eleventh. But in the lately
discovered Song of Eulalia, we have now a specimen
of the Langue d'Oil, or the ancient Northern French,
anterior in date to the earliest poetic specimen of the
Langue d'Oc, or the ancient Provençal. Nothing
can be a better preparation for the study of the comparative
grammar of the ancient Aryan languages than
a careful perusal of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Grammar of the
Six Romance Languages”</span> by Professor Diez.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though in a general way we trace these six Romance
languages back to Latin, yet it has been pointed out before
that the classical Latin would fail to supply a complete
explanation of their origin. Many of the ingredients
of the Neo-Latin dialects must be sought for in
the ancient dialects of Italy and her provinces. More
than one dialect of Latin was spoken there before the
rise of Rome, and some important fragments have been
preserved to us, in inscriptions, of the Umbrian spoken
in the north, and of the Oscan spoken to the south of
Rome. The Oscan language, spoken by the Samnites,
now rendered intelligible by the labors of Mommsen,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had produced a literature before the time of Livius
Andronicus; and the tables of Iguvio, so elaborately
treated by Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, bear witness to a
priestly literature among the Umbrians at a very early
period. Oscan was still spoken under the Roman emperors,
and so were minor local dialects in the south
and the north. As soon as the literary language of
Rome became classical and unchangeable, the first
start was made in the future career of those dialects
which, even at the time of Dante, are still called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vulgar</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">popular</span></em>.<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> A great deal, no doubt, of the corruption
of these modern dialects is due to the fact that,
in the form in which we know them after the eighth
century, they are really Neo-Latin dialects as adopted
by the Teutonic barbarians; full, not only of Teutonic
words, but of Teutonic idioms, phrases, and constructions.
French is provincial Latin as spoken by the
Franks, a Teutonic race; and, to a smaller extent, the
same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">barbarizing</span></em> has affected all other Roman dialects.
But from the very beginning, the stock with which the
Neo-Latin dialects started was not the classical Latin, but
the vulgar, local, provincial dialects of the middle, the
lower, and the lowest classes of the Roman Empire.
Many of the words which give to French and Italian
their classical appearance, are really of much later
date, and were imported into them by mediæval scholars,
lawyers, and divines; thus escaping the rough
treatment to which the original vulgar dialects were
subjected by the Teutonic conquerors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next branch of the Indo-European family of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speech is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hellenic</span></em>. Its history is well known from
the time of Homer to the present day. The only remark
which the comparative philologist has to make is
that the idea of making Greek the parent of Latin, is
more preposterous than deriving English from German;
the fact being that there are many forms in Latin more
primitive than their corresponding forms in Greek.
The idea of Pelasgians as the common ancestors of
Greeks and Romans is another of those grammatical
mythes, but hardly requires at present any serious refutation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth branch of our family is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Celtic</span></em>. The
Celts seem to have been the first of the Aryans to arrive
in Europe; but the pressure of subsequent migrations,
particularly of Teutonic tribes, has driven them
towards the westernmost parts, and latterly from Ireland
across the Atlantic. At present the only remaining
dialects are the Kymric and Gadhelic. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kymric</span></em>
comprises the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Welsh</span></em>; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cornish</span></em>, lately extinct;
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Armorican</span></em>, of Brittany. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gadhelic</span></em> comprises
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></em>; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Galic</span></em> of the west coast of Scotland;
and the dialect of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Isle of Man</span></em>. Although
these Celtic dialects are still spoken, the Celts themselves
can no longer be considered an independent
nation, like the Germans or Slaves. In former times,
however, they not only enjoyed political autonomy, but
asserted it successfully against Germans and Romans.
Gaul, Belgium, and Britain were Celtic dominions,
and the north of Italy was chiefly inhabited by them.
In the time of Herodotus we find Celts in Spain; and
Switzerland, the Tyrol, and the country south of the
Danube have once been the seats of Celtic tribes. But
after repeated inroads into the regions of civilization,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
familiarizing Latin and Greek writers with the names
of their kings, they disappear from the east of Europe.
Brennus is supposed to mean king, the Welsh <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brennin</span></em>.
A Brennus conquered Rome (390), another Brennus
threatened Delphi (280). And about the same time a
Celtic colony settled in Asia, and founded Galatia, where
the language spoken at the time of St. Jerome was
still that of the Gauls. Celtic words may be found in
German, Slavonic, and even in Latin, but only as
foreign terms, and their amount is much smaller than
commonly supposed. A far larger number of Latin
and German words have since found their way into
the modern Celtic dialects, and these have frequently
been mistaken by Celtic enthusiasts for original words,
from which German and Latin might, in their turn, be
derived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fifth branch, which is commonly called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Slavonic</span></em>,
I prefer to designate by the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Windic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Winidae</span></em>
being one of the most ancient and comprehensive
names by which these tribes were known to the early
historians of Europe. We have to divide these tribes
into two divisions, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lettic</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Slavonic</span></em>, and we
shall have to subdivide the Slavonic again into a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">South-East
Slavonic</span></em> and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">West Slavonic</span></em> branch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lettic</span></em> division consists of languages hardly known
to the student of literature, but of great importance to
the student of language. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lettish</span></em> is the language now
spoken in Kurland and Livonia. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lithuanian</span></em> is the
name given to a language still spoken by about 200,000
people in Eastern Prussia, and by more than a million
of people in the coterminous parts of Russia. The
earliest literary document of Lithuanian is a small catechism
of 1547.<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>
In this, and even in the language as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now spoken by the Lithuanian peasant, there are some
grammatical forms more primitive, and more like Sanskrit,
than the corresponding forms in Greek and Latin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Prussian</span></em>, which is nearly related to Lithuanian,
became extinct in the seventeenth century,
and the entire literature which it has left behind consists
in an old catechism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lettish</span></em> is the language of Kurland and Livonia, more
modern in its grammar than Lithuanian, yet not immediately
derived from it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now come to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Slavonic</span></em> languages, properly so
called. The eastern branch comprehends the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Russian</span></em>
with various local dialects; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bulgarian</span></em>, and the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Illyrian</span></em>. The most ancient document of this eastern
branch is the so-called Ecclesiastical Slavonic, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
ancient Bulgarian, into which Cyrillus and Methodius
translated the Bible, in the middle of the ninth century.
This is still the authorized version<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> of the Bible
for the whole Slavonic race; and to the student of the
Slavonic languages, it is what Gothic is to the student
of German. The modern Bulgarian, on the contrary,
as far as grammatical forms are concerned, is the most
reduced among the Slavonic dialects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Illyrian</span></em> is a convenient or inconvenient name to
comprehend the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Servian</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Croatian</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Slovinian</span></em> dialects.
Literary fragments of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Slovinian</span></em> go back as far
as the tenth century.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The western branch comprehends the language of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Poland</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bohemia</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lusatia</span></em>. The oldest specimen
of Polish belongs to the fourteenth century: the Psalter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Margarite. The Bohemian language was, till
lately, traced back to the ninth century. But most of
these old Bohemian poems are now considered spurious;
and it is doubtful, even, whether an ancient interlinear
translation of the Gospel of St. John can be ascribed
to the tenth century.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The language of Lusatia is spoken, probably, by no
more than 150,000 people, known in Germany by the
name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Wends</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have examined all the languages of our first or
Aryan family, which are spoken in Europe, with one
exception, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Albanian</span></em>. This language is clearly a
member of the same family; and as it is sufficiently
distinct from Greek or any other recognized language,
it has been traced back to one of the neighboring races
of the Greeks, the Illyrians, and is supposed to be the
only surviving representative of the various so-called
barbarous tongues which surrounded and interpenetrated
the dialects of Greece.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now pass on from Europe to Asia; and here we
begin at once, on the extreme south, with the languages
of India. As I sketched the history of Sanskrit
in one of my former Lectures, it must suffice, at
present, to mark the different periods of that language,
beginning, about 1500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, with the dialect of the
Vedas, which is followed by the modern Sanskrit; the
popular dialects of the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>; the Prakrit
dialects of the plays; and the spoken dialects, such
as Hindí, Hindústání, Mahrattí, Bengalí. There are
many points of great interest to the student of language,
in the long history of the speech of India; and
it has been truly said that Sanskrit is to the science of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
language what mathematics are to astronomy. In an
introductory course of lectures, however, like the present,
it would be out of place to enter on a minute
analysis of the grammatical organism of this language
of languages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is one point only on which I may be allowed
to say a few words. I have frequently been asked,
<span class="tei tei-q">“But how can you prove that Sanskrit literature is so
old as it is supposed to be? How can you fix any
Indian dates before the time of Alexander's conquest?
What dependence can be placed on Sanskrit manuscripts
which may have been forged or interpolated?”</span>
It is easier to ask such questions than to answer them,
at least to answer them briefly and intelligibly. But,
perhaps, the following argument will serve as a partial
answer, and show that Sanskrit was the spoken language
of India at least some centuries before the time
of Solomon. In the hymns of the Veda, which are
the oldest literary compositions in Sanskrit, the geographical
horizon of the poets is, for the greater part,
limited to the north-west of India. There are very few
passages in which any allusions to the sea or the sea-coast
occur, whereas the snowy mountains, and the rivers
of the Penjáb, and the scenery of the Upper Ganges
valley are familiar objects to the ancient bards. There
is no doubt, in fact, that the people who spoke Sanskrit
came into India from the north, and gradually
extended their sway to the south and east. Now, at the
time of Solomon, it can be proved that Sanskrit was
spoken at least as far south as the mouth of the Indus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You remember the fleet of Tharshish<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> which Solomon
had at sea, together with the navy of Hiram, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which came once in three years, bringing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gold</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">silver</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ivory</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apes</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peacocks</span></em>. The same navy,
which was stationed on the shore of the Red Sea, is
said to have fetched gold from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ophir</span></em>,<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> and to have
brought, likewise, great plenty of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">algum</span></em><a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> trees and
precious stones from Ophir.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, a great deal has been written to find out
where this Ophir was; but there can be no doubt
that it was in India. The names for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apes</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peacocks</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ivory</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">algum</span></em>-trees are foreign words in Hebrew, as
much as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gutta-percha</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tobacco</span></em> are in English. Now,
if we wished to know from what part of the world
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gutta-percha</span></em> was first imported into England, we might
safely conclude that it came from that country where
the name, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gutta-percha</span></em>, formed part of the
spoken language.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a>
If, therefore, we can find a language in which
the names for peacock, apes, ivory, and algum-tree,
which are foreign in Hebrew, are indigenous, we may
be certain that the country in which that language
was spoken must have been the Ophir of the Bible.
That language is no other but Sanskrit.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Apes</span></em> are called, in Hebrew, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">koph</span></em>, a word without an
etymology in the Semitic languages, but nearly identical
in sound with the Sanskrit name of ape, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kapi</span></em>.

in Hebrew, but it is most likely a corruption of
the Sanskrit name for elephant, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibha</span></em>, preceded by the

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Peacocks</span></em> are called in Hebrew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tukhi-im</span></em>, and this
finds its explanation in the name still used for peacock
on the coast of Malabar, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">togëi</span></em>, which in turn has been
derived from the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">śikhin</span></em>, meaning furnished
with a crest.

indigenous in India, though of course they might have
been found in other countries likewise. Not so the

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">algum</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almug</span></em> for sandalwood. Sandalwood is found
indigenous on the coast of Malabar only; and one of

This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">valgu</span></em>(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ka</span></em>) is clearly the name which Jewish and

(vii. 1) gives us the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Abiria</span></em>, above <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pattalene</span></em>.
In the same locality Hindu geographers place the people
called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Abhîra</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Âbhîra</span></em>; and in the same neighborhood
MacMurdo, in his account of the province of
Cutch, still knows a race of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahirs</span></em>,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> the descendants, in

If, then, in the Veda the people who spoke Sanskrit
were still settled in the north of India, whereas
at the time of Solomon their language had extended
to Cutch and even the Malabar coast, this will show
that at all events Sanskrit is not of yesterday, and
that it is as old, at least, as the book of Job, in which
the gold of Ophir is mentioned.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a>

Most closely allied to Sanskrit, more particularly to
the Sanskrit of the Veda, is the ancient language of
the Zend-avesta,<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> the so-called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Zend</span></em>, or
sacred language of the Zoroastrians or Fire-worshippers. It
was, in fact, chiefly through the Sanskrit, and with
the help of comparative philology, that the ancient
dialect of the Parsis or Fire-worshippers was deciphered.
The MSS. had been preserved by the Parsi
priests at Bombay, where a colony of fire-worshippers
had fled in the tenth century,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> and where it has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
risen since to considerable wealth and influence.
Other settlements of Guebres are to be found in
Yezd and parts of Kerman. A Frenchman, Anquetil
Duperron, was the first to translate the Zend-avesta,
but his translation was not from the original, but from
a modern Persian translation. The first European
who attempted to read the original words of Zoroaster
was Rask, the Dane; and after his premature death,
Burnouf, in France, achieved one of the greatest triumphs
in modern scholarship by deciphering the language
of the Zend-avesta, and establishing its close
relationship with Sanskrit. The same doubts which
were expressed about the age and the genuineness of
the Veda, were repeated with regard to the Zend-avesta,
by men of high authority as oriental scholars,
by Sir W. Jones himself, and even by the late Professor
Wilson. But Burnouf's arguments, based at
first on grammatical evidence only, were irresistible,
and have of late been most signally confirmed by the
discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius and
Xerxes. That there was a Zoroaster, an ancient sage,
was known long before Burnouf. Plato speaks of a
teacher of Zoroaster's Magic (Μαγεία), and calls Zoroaster
the son of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Oromazes</span></em>.<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This name of Oromazes is important; for Oromazes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is clearly meant for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ormuzd</span></em>, the god of the Zoroastrians.
The name of this god, as read in the inscriptions
of Darius and Xerxes, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Auramazdâ</span></em>, which comes
very near to Plato's Oromazes.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> Thus Darius says,
in one passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“Through the grace of Auramazda I
am king; Auramazda gave me the kingdom.”</span> But
what is the meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Auramazda</span></em>? We receive a
hint from one passage in the Achæmenian inscriptions,
where Auramazda is divided into two words, both
being declined. The genitive of Auramazda occurs
there as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aurahya mazdâha</span></em>. But even this is unintelligible,
and is, in fact, nothing but a phonetic corruption
of the name of the supreme Deity as it occurs
on every page of the Zend-avesta, namely, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô
mazdâo</span></em> (nom.). Here, too, both words are declined;
and instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em>, we also find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mazdâo
ahurô</span></em>.<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>
Well, this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em> is represented in
the Zend-avesta as the creator and ruler of the world;
as good, holy, and true; and as doing battle against
all that is evil, dark, and false. <span class="tei tei-q">“The wicked perish
through the wisdom and holiness of the living wise
Spirit.”</span> In the oldest hymns, the power of darkness,
which is opposed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em> has not yet received
its proper name, which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Angrô mainyus</span></em>, the
later <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahriman</span></em>; but it is spoken of as a power, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Drukhs</span></em>
or deceit; and the principal doctrine which Zoroaster
came to preach was that we must choose between these
two powers, that we must be good, and not bad. These
are his words:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning there was a pair of twins, two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirits, each of a peculiar activity. These are the
Good and the Base in thought, word, and deed.
Choose one of these two spirits; Be good, not
base!”</span><a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a>

Or again:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ahuramazda is holy, true, to be honored through
veracity, through holy deeds.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You cannot serve
both.”</span>

Now, if we wanted to prove that Anglo-Saxon was
a real language, and more ancient than English, a mere
comparison of a few words such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lord</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hlafford</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gospel</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">godspel</span></em> would be
sufficient. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hlafford</span></em> has a
meaning; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lord</span></em> has none; therefore we may safely say
that without such a compound as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hlafford</span></em>, the word
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lord</span></em> could never have arisen. The same, if we compare
the language of the Zend-avesta with that of the
cuneiform inscriptions of Darius. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Auramazdâ</span></em> is clearly
a corruption of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em>, and if the language of
the Mountain-records of Behistun is genuine, then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à
fortiori</span></span>, is the language of the Zend-avesta genuine, as
deciphered by Burnouf, long before he had deciphered
the language of Cyrus and Darius. But what is the
meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em>? Here Zend does not give
us an answer; but we must look to Sanskrit, as the
more primitive language, just as we looked from French
to Italian, in order to discover the original form and
meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feu</span></em>. According to the rules which govern
the changes of words, common to Zend and Sanskrit,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em> corresponds to the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Asuro medhas</span></em>;
and this would mean the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wise Spirit,”</span> neither
more nor less.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have editions, translations, and commentaries of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Zend-avesta by Burnouf, Brockhaus, Spiegel, and
Westergaard. Yet there still remains much to be done.
Dr. Haug, now settled at Poona, has lately taken up
the work which Burnouf left unfinished. He has
pointed out that the text of the Zend-avesta, as we
have it, comprises fragments of very different antiquity,
and that the most ancient only, the so-called Gâthâs,
can be ascribed to Zarathustra. <span class="tei tei-q">“This portion,”</span> he
writes in a lecture just received from India, <span class="tei tei-q">“compared
with the whole bulk of the Zend fragments is very
small; but by the difference of dialect it is easily
recognized. The most important pieces written in
this peculiar dialect are called Gâthâs or songs, arranged
in five small collections; they have different
metres, which mostly agree with those of the Veda;
their language is very near to the Vedic dialect.”</span> It
is to be regretted that in the same lecture, which holds
out the promise of so much that will be extremely valuable,
Dr. Haug should have lent his authority to the
opinion that Zoroaster or Zarathustra is mentioned in
the Rig-Veda as Jaradashṭi. The meaning of jaradashti
in the Rig-Veda may be seen in the Sanskrit
Dictionary of the Russian Academy, and no Sanskrit
scholar would seriously think of translating the word
by Zoroaster.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At what time Zoroaster lived, is a more difficult
question which we cannot discuss at present.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> It must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suffice if we have proved that he lived, and that his
language, the Zend, is a real language, and anterior
in time to the language of the cuneiform inscriptions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We trace the subsequent history of the Persian language
from Zend to the inscriptions of the Achæmenian
dynasty; from thence to what is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pehlevi</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Huzvaresh</span></em>
(better Huzûresh), the language of the Sassanian
dynasty (226-651), as it is found in the dialect of
the translations of the Zend-avesta, and in the official
language of the Sassanian coins and inscriptions. This
is considerably mixed with Semitic elements, probably
imported from Syria. In a still later form, freed also
from the Semitic elements which abound in Pehlevi,
the language of Persia appears again as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Parsi</span></em>, which
differs but little from the language of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Firdusi</span></em>, the great
epic poet of Persia, the author of the Shahnámeh, about
1000 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a. d.</span></span> The later history of Persian consists entirely
in the gradual increase of Arabic words, which
have crept into the language since the conquest of Persia
and the conversion of the Persians to the religion
of Mohammed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other languages which evince by their grammar
and vocabulary a general relationship with Sanskrit
and Persian, but which have received too distinct and
national a character to be classed as mere dialects, are
the languages <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of Afghanistan</span></em> or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pushtú</span></em>, the language
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bokhára</span></em>, the language of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kurds</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ossetian</span></em>
language in the Caucasus, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Armenian</span></em>. Much
might be said on every one of these tongues and their
claims to be classed as independent members of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Aryan family; but our time is limited, nor has any one
of them acquired, as yet, that importance which belongs
to the vernaculars of India, Persia, Greece, Italy, and
Germany, and to other branches of Aryan speech which
have been analyzed critically, and may be studied historically
in the successive periods of their literary existence.
There is, however, one more language which
we have omitted to mention, and which belongs equally
to Asia and Europe, the language of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gipsies</span></em>. This
language, though most degraded in its grammar, and
with a dictionary stolen from all the countries through
which the Zingaris passed, is clearly an exile from Hindústán.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You see, from the diagram before you,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> that it is
possible to divide the whole Aryan family into two
divisions: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Southern</span></em>, including the Indic and Iranic
classes, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Northern</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">North-western</span></em>, comprising
all the rest. Sanskrit and Zend share certain words
and grammatical forms in common which do not exist
in any of the other Aryan languages; and there can
be no doubt that the ancestors of the poets of the Veda
and of the worshippers of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahurô mazdâo</span></em> lived together
for some time after they had left the original home of
the whole Aryan race. For let us see this clearly:
the genealogical classification of languages, as drawn
in this diagram, has an historical meaning. As sure as
the six Romance dialects point to an original home of
Italian shepherds on the seven hills at Rome, the Aryan
languages together point to an earlier period of language,
when the first ancestors of the Indians, the Persians,
the Greeks, the Romans, the Slaves, the Celts,
and the Germans were living together within the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enclosures, nay under the same roof. There was a
time when out of many possible names for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">father</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">daughter</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">son</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dog</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cow</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heaven</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earth</span></em>, those
which we find in all the Aryan languages were framed,
and obtained a mastery <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the struggle for life</span></em> which is
carried on among synonymous words as much as among
plants and animals. Look at the comparative table of
the auxiliary verb AS, to be, in the different Aryan
languages. The selection of the root AS out of many
roots, equally applicable to the idea of being, and the
joining of this root with one set of personal terminations,
all originally personal pronouns, were individual
acts, or if you like, historical events. They took place
once, at a certain date and in a certain place; and as
we find the same forms preserved by all the members
of the Aryan family, it follows that before the ancestors
of the Indians and Persians started for the south, and
the leaders of the Greek, Roman, Celtic, Teutonic,
and Slavonic colonies marched towards the shores of
Europe, there was a small clan of Aryans, settled probably
on the highest elevation of Central Asia, speaking
a language, not yet Sanskrit or Greek or German, but
containing the dialectical germs of all; a clan that had
advanced to a state of agricultural civilization; that
had recognized the bonds of blood, and sanctioned the
bonds of marriage; and that invoked the Giver of
Light and Life in heaven by the same name which you
may still hear in the temples of Benares, in the basilicas
of Rome, and in our own churches and cathedrals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this clan broke up, the ancestors of the Indians
and Zoroastrians must have remained together for some
time in their migrations or new settlements; and I believe
that it was the reform of Zoroaster which produced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at last the split between the worshippers of the Vedic
gods and the worshippers of Ormuzd. Whether, besides
this division into a southern and northern branch, it is
possible by the same test (the community of particular
words and forms), to discover the successive periods
when the Germans separated from the Slaves, the Celts
from the Italians, or the Italians from the Greeks, seems
more than doubtful. The attempts made by different
scholars have led to different and by no means satisfactory
results;<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> and it seems best, for the present, to
trace each of the northern classes back to its own dialect,
and to account for the more special coincidences between
such languages as, for instance, the Slavonic and Teutonic,
by admitting that the ancestors of these races
preserved from the beginning certain dialectical peculiarities
which existed before, as well as after, the separation
of the Aryan family.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture VI. Comparative Grammar.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The genealogical classification of the Aryan languages
was founded, as we saw, on a close comparison of
the grammatical characteristics of each; and it is the object
of such works as Bopp's <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Grammar”</span>
to show that the grammatical articulation of Sanskrit,
Zend, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic,
was produced once and for all; and that the apparent
differences in the terminations of Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin, must be explained by laws of phonetic decay, peculiar
to each dialect, which modified the original common
Aryan type, and changed it into so many national
languages. It might seem, therefore, as if the object
of comparative grammar was attained as soon as the
exact genealogical relationship of languages had been
settled; and those who only look to the higher problems
of the science of language have not hesitated to
declare that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no painsworthy difficulty nor dispute
about declension, number, case, and gender of
nouns.”</span> But although it is certainly true that comparative
grammar is only a means, and that it has well
nigh taught us all that it has to teach,—at least in the
Aryan family of speech,—it is to be hoped that, in the
science of language, it will always retain that prominent
place which it has obtained through the labors of Bopp,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Grimm, Pott, Benfey, Curtius, Kuhn, and others. Besides,
comparative grammar has more to do than simply
to compare. It would be easy enough to place side by
side the paradigms of declension and conjugation in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, and the other Aryan dialects, and
to mark both their coincidences and their differences.
But after we have done this, and after we have explained
the phonetic laws which cause the primitive
Aryan type to assume that national variety which we
admire in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, new problems
arise of a more interesting nature. We know that
grammatical terminations, as they are now called, were
originally independent words, and had their own purpose
and meaning. Is it possible, after comparative
grammar has established the original forms of the Aryan
terminations, to trace them back to independent words,
and to discover their original purpose and meaning?
You will remember that this was the point from which
we started. We wanted to know why the termination
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em> should change a present into a past act.
We saw that before answering this question we had to
discover the most original form of this termination by
tracing it from English to Gothic, and afterwards, if
necessary, from Gothic to Sanskrit. We now return
to our original question, namely, What is language that
a mere formal change, such as that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>,
should produce so very material a difference?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us clearly see what we mean if we make a distinction
between the radical and formal elements of a
language; and by formal elements I mean not only the
terminations of declension and conjugation, but all derivative
elements; all, in fact, that is not radical. Our
view on the origin of language must chiefly depend on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the view which we take of these formal, as opposed to
the radical, elements of speech. Those who consider
that language is a conventional production, base their arguments
principally on these formal elements. The inflections
of words, they maintain, are the best proof
that language was made by mutual agreement. They
look upon them as mere letters or syllables without any
meaning by themselves; and if they were asked why
the mere addition of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em> changes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>, or
why the addition of the syllable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rai</span></em> gave to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'aime</span></em>, I
love, the power of a future, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'aimerai</span></em>, they would answer,
that it was so because, at a very early time in
the history of the world, certain persons, or families,
or clans, agreed that it should be so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view was opposed by another which represents
language as an organic and almost a living being, and
explains its formal elements as produced by a principle

essential part of language existed as completely (although
only implicitly) in the primitive germ, as the

This view was first propounded by Frederick Schlegel,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>

and it is still held by many with whom poetical phraseology
takes the place of sound and severe reasoning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The science of language adopts neither of these
views. As to imagining a congress for settling the
proper exponents of such relations as nominative, genitive,
singular, plural, active, and passive, it stands
to reason that if such abstruse problems could have
been discussed in a language void of inflections, there
was no inducement for agreeing on a more perfect
means of communication. And as to imagining language,
that is to say nouns and verbs, endowed with
an inward principle of growth, all we can say is, that
such a conception is really inconceivable. Language
may be conceived as a production, but it cannot be
conceived as a substance that could itself produce.
But the science of language has nothing to do with
mere theories, whether conceivable or not. It collects
facts, and its only object is to account for these facts,
as far as possible. Instead of looking on inflections in
general either as conventional signs or natural excrescences,
it takes each termination by itself, establishes
its most primitive form by means of comparison,
and then treats that primitive syllable as it would treat
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any other part of language,—namely, as something
which was originally intended to convey a meaning.
Whether we are still able to discover the original intention
of every part of language is quite a different
question, and it should be admitted at once that many
grammatical forms, after they have been restored to
their most primitive type, are still without an explanation.
But with every year new discoveries are made
by means of careful inductive reasoning. We become
more familiar every day with the secret ways of language,
and there is no reason to doubt that in the end
grammatical analysis will be as successful as chemical
analysis. Grammar, though sometimes very bewildering
to us in its later stages, is originally a much less
formidable undertaking than is commonly supposed.
What is grammar after all but declension and conjugation?
Originally declension could not have been anything
but the composition of a noun with some other
word expressive of number and case. How the number
was expressed, we saw in a former lecture; and the
same process led to the formation of cases.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the locative is formed in various ways in
Chinese:<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> one is by adding such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ćung</span></em>, the
middle, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">néi</span></em>, inside. Thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kûŏ-ćung</span></em>, in the empire;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i sûí ćung</span></em>, within a year. The instrumental is formed
by the preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ẏ</span></em>, which preposition is an old root,
meaning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to use</span></em>. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ẏ ting</span></em>, with a stick, where in
Latin we should use the ablative, in Greek the dative.
Now, however complicated the declensions, regular and
irregular, may be in Greek and Latin, we may be certain
that originally they were formed by this simple
method of composition.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was originally in all the Aryan languages a
case expressive of locality, which grammarians call the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">locative</span></em>. In Sanskrit every substantive has its locative,
as well as its genitive, dative, and accusative. Thus,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heart</span></em> in Sanskrit is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hṛid</span></em>; in the heart, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hṛidi</span></em>.
Here, therefore, the termination of the locative is simply short
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em>. This short <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em> is a demonstrative root, and in all probability
the same root which in Latin produced the
preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>. The Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hṛidi</span></em> represents, therefore,
an original compound, as it were, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heart-within</span></em>,
which gradually became settled as one of the recognized
cases of nouns ending in consonants. If we look
to Chinese,<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> we find that the locative is expressed there
in the same manner, but with a greater freedom in the
choice of the words expressive of locality. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
empire,”</span> is expressed by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kûŏ ćung</span></em>; <span class="tei tei-q">“within a year,”</span> is
expressed by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ĭ sûí ćung</span></em>. Instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ćung</span></em>, however,
we might have employed other terms also, such as, for
instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">néi</span></em>, inside. It might be said that the formation
of so primitive a case as the locative offers little
difficulty, but that this process of composition fails to
account for the origin of the more abstract cases, the
accusative, the dative, and genitive. If we derive our
notions of the cases from philosophical grammar, it is
true, no doubt, that it would be difficult to convey by
a simple composition the abstract relations supposed to
be expressed by the terminations of the genitive, dative,
and accusative. But remember that these are only
general categories under which philosophers and grammarians
endeavored to arrange the facts of language.
The people with whom language grew up knew nothing
of datives and accusatives. Everything that is abstract
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in language was originally concrete. If people wanted
to say the King of Rome, they meant really the King
at Rome, and they would readily have used what I
have just described as the locative; whereas the more
abstract idea of the genitive would never enter into
their system of thought. But more than this, it can
be proved that the locative has actually taken, in some
cases, the place of the genitive. In Latin, for instance,
the old genitive of nouns in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></em>. This we find
still in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater familiâs</span></em>, instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pater familiæ</span></em>.
The Umbrian and Oscan dialects retained the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> throughout
as the sign of the genitive after nouns in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">æ</span></em>
of the genitive was originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ai</span></em>, that is to say, the old
locative in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“King of Rome,”</span> if rendered by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rex
Romæ</span></em>, meant really <span class="tei tei-q">“King at Rome.”</span> And here you
will see how grammar, which ought to be the most
logical of all sciences, is frequently the most illogical.
A boy is taught at school, that if he wants to say <span class="tei tei-q">“I
am staying at Rome,”</span> he must use the genitive to express
the locative. How a logician or grammarian can
so twist and turn the meaning of the genitive as to
make it express rest in a place, is not for us to inquire;
but, if he succeeded, his pupil would at once use
the genitive of Carthage (Carthaginis) or of Athens
(Athenarum) for the same purpose, and he would then
have to be told that these genitives could not be used
in the same manner as the genitive of nouns in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a.</span></em>
How all this is achieved by what is called philosophical
grammar, we know not; but comparative grammar
at once removes all difficulty. It is only in the first
declension that the locative has supplanted the genitive,
whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Carthaginis</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Athenarum</span></em>, being real genitives,
could never be employed to express a locative.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A special case, such as the locative, may be generalized
into the more general genitive, but not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You see thus by one instance how what grammarians
call a genitive was formed by the same process
of composition which we can watch in Chinese, and
which we can prove to have taken place in the original
language of the Aryans. And the same applies to the
dative. If a boy is told that the dative expresses a relation
of one object to another, less direct than that of
the accusative, he may well wonder how such a flying
arch could ever have been built up with the scanty
materials which language has at her disposal; but he
will be still more surprised if, after having realized this
grammatical abstraction, he is told that in Greek, in
order to convey the very definite idea of being in a
place, he has to use after certain nouns the termination
of the dative. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am staying at Salamis,”</span> must
be expressed by the dative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Salamînĭ</span></em>. If you ask why?
Comparative grammar again can alone give an answer.
The termination of the Greek dative in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em>, was originally
the termination of the locative. The locative may well
convey the meaning of the dative, but the faded features
of the dative can never express the fresh distinctness
of the locative. The dative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Salamînĭ</span></em> was first a locative.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I live at Salamis,”</span> never conveyed the meaning,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I live to Salamis.”</span> On the contrary, the dative,
in such phrases as <span class="tei tei-q">“I give it to the father,”</span> was originally
a locative; and after expressing at first the palpable
relation of <span class="tei tei-q">“I give it unto the father,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“I
place it on or in the father,”</span> it gradually assumed the
more general, the less local, less colored aspect which
logicians and grammarians ascribe to their
datives.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the explanation just given of some of the cases
in Greek and Latin should seem too artificial or too
forced, we have only to think of French in order to see
exactly the same process repeated under our eyes. The
most abstract relations of the genitive, as, for instance,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The immortality of the soul”</span> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">l'immortalité de l'âme</span></em>);
or of the dative, as, for instance, <span class="tei tei-q">“I trust myself to
God”</span> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je me fie à Dieu</span></em>), are expressed by prepositions,
such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ad</span></em>, which in Latin had the distinct
local meanings of <span class="tei tei-q">“down from,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“towards.”</span>
Nay, the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></em>, which have taken the
place of the German terminations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></em>, are likewise
prepositions of an originally local character. The
only difference between our cases and those of the ancient
languages consists in this,—that the determining
element is now placed before the word, whereas, in the
original language of the Aryans, it was placed at the
end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What applies to the cases of nouns, applies with
equal truth to the terminations of verbs. It may seem
difficult to discover in the personal terminations of
Greek and Latin the exact pronouns which were added
to a verbal base in order to express, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> love, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou</span></em> lovest,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> loves; but it stands to reason that originally these
terminations must have been the same in all languages,—namely,
personal pronouns. We may be puzzled by the terminations
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou lovest</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he loves</span></em>, where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">st</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> can hardly be identified with the modern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em>; but we have only to place all the Aryan dialects
together, and we shall see at once that they point
back to an original set of terminations which can easily
be brought to tell their own story.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us begin with modern formations, because we
have here more daylight for watching the intricate and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sometimes wayward movements of language; or, better
still, let us begin with an imaginary case, or with what
may be called the language of the future, in order to
see quite clearly how, what we should call grammatical
forms, may arise. Let us suppose that the slaves in
America were to rise against their masters, and, after
gaining some victories, were to sail back in large numbers
to some part of Central Africa, beyond the reach
of their white enemies or friends. Let us suppose these
men availing themselves of the lessons they had learnt
in their captivity, and gradually working out a civilization
of their own. It is quite possible that some centuries
hence, a new Livingstone might find among the
descendants of the American slaves, a language, a literature,
laws, and manners, bearing a striking similitude
to those of his own country. What an interesting
problem for any future historian and ethnologist!
Yet there are problems in the past history of the world
of equal interest, which have been and are still to be
solved by the student of language. Now I believe that
a careful examination of the language of the descendants
of those escaped slaves would suffice to determine
with perfect certainty their past history, even though
no documents and no tradition had preserved the story
of their captivity and liberation. At first, no doubt,
the threads might seem hopelessly entangled. A missionary
might surprise the scholars of Europe by an
account of that new African language. He might describe
it at first as very imperfect—as a language, for
instance, so poor that the same word had to be used to
express the most heterogeneous ideas. He might point
out how the same sound, without any change of accent,
meant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ceremony</span></em>, a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">workman</span></em>, and was used also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as a verb in the sense of literary composition. All
these, he might say, are expressed in that strange dialect
by the sound <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rait</span></em> (right, rite, wright, write). He
might likewise observe that this dialect, as poor almost
as Chinese, had hardly any grammatical inflections,
and that it had no genders, except in a few words such
as man-of-war, and a railway-engine, which were both
conceived as feminine beings, and spoken of as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">she</span></em>.
He might then mention an even more extraordinary
feature, namely, that although this language had no
terminations for the masculine and feminine genders of
nouns, it employed a masculine and feminine termination
after the affirmative particle, according as it was
addressed to a lady or a gentleman. Their affirmative
particle being the same as the English, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em>, they
added a final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></em> to it if addressed to a man, and a final
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></em> if addressed to a lady: that is to say, instead of
simply saying, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em>, these descendants of the escaped
American slaves said <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesr</span></em> to a man, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesm</span></em> to a
lady.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Absurd as this may sound, I can assure you that
the descriptions which are given of the dialects of savage
tribes, as explained for the first time by travellers
or missionaries, are even more extraordinary. But let
us consider now what the student of language would
have to do, if such forms as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yeśr</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yeśm</span></em> were, for
the first time, brought under his notice. He would
first have to trace them back historically, as far as possible
to their more original types, and if he discovered
their connection with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Sir</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Ma'm</span></em>, he would
point out how such contractions were most likely to
spring up in a vulgar dialect. After having traced
back the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesr</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesm of</span></em> the free African negroes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the idiom of their former American masters, the
etymologist would next inquire how such phrases as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Sir</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Madam</span></em>, came to be used on the
American continent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finding nothing analogous in the dialects of the aboriginal
inhabitants of America, he would be led, by a
mere comparison of words, to the languages of Europe,
and here again, first to the language of England. Even
if no historical documents had been preserved, the documents
of language would show that the white masters,
whose language the ancestors of the free Africans
adopted during their servitude, came originally from
England, and, within certain limits, it would even be
possible to fix the time when the English language was
first transplanted to America. That language must
have passed, at least, the age of Chaucer before it migrated
to the New World. For Chaucer has two affirmative
particles, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yea</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em>, and he distinguishes
between the two. He uses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em> only in answer to negative
questions. For instance, in answer to <span class="tei tei-q">“Does he
not go?”</span> he would say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em>. In all other cases
Chaucer uses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yea</span></em>. To a question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Does he go?”</span>
he would answer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yea</span></em>. He observes the same distinction
between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nay</span></em>, the former being used after
negative, the latter after all other questions. This distinction
became obsolete soon after Sir Thomas More,<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>
and it must have become obsolete before phrases such
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Sir</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes Madam</span></em> could have assumed their
stereotyped character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is still more historical information to be
gained from these phrases. The word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em> is Anglo-Saxon,
the same as the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ja</span></em>, and it therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reveals the fact that the white masters of the American
slaves who crossed the Atlantic after the time of Chaucer,
had crossed the Channel at an earlier period after
leaving the continental fatherland of the Angles and
Saxons. The words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Madam</span></em> tell us still more.
They are Norman words, and they could only have
been imposed on the Anglo-Saxons of Britain by Norman
conquerors. They tell us more than this. For
these Normans or Northmen spoke originally a Teutonic
dialect, closely allied to Anglo-Saxon, and in that
dialect words such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Madam</span></em> could never have
sprung up. We may conclude therefore that, previous
to the Norman conquest, the Teutonic Northmen must
have made a sufficiently long stay in one of the Roman
provinces to forget their own and adopt the language
of the Roman Provincials.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may now trace back the Norman <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Madam</span></em> to the
French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Madame</span></em>, and we recognize in this a corruption
of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mea domina</span></em>, my mistress. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Domina</span></em> was
changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">domna</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">donna</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dame</span></em>, and the same
word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dame</span></em> was also used as a masculine in the sense of lord,
as a corruption of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Domino</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Domno</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Donno</span></em>. The
temporal lord ruling as ecclesiastical seigneur under the
bishop, was called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vidame</span></em>, as the Vidame of Chartres,
&amp;c. The French interjection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dame!</span></em> has no connection
with a similar exclamation in English, but it simply
means Lord! <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dame-Dieu</span></em> in old French is Lord God.
A derivative of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Domina</span></em>, mistress, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dominicella</span></em>, which
became <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Demoiselle</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Damsel</span></em>. The masculine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dame</span></em>
for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Domino</span></em>, Lord, was afterwards replaced by the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></em>, a translation of the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elder</span></em>. This word
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elder</span></em> was a title of honor, and we have it still both in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alderman</span></em>, and in what is originally the same, the English
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Earl</span></em>, the Norse <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jarl</span></em>, a corruption of the A.-S.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ealdor</span></em>. This title <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></em>, meaning
originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">older</span></em>, was but rarely<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> applied to ladies as a title of honor. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></em>
was changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seigneur</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seigneur</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sieur</span></em>, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sieur</span></em> soon dwindled down to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see how in two short phrases, such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesr</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yesm</span></em>, long chapters of history might be read. If
a general destruction of books, such as took place in
China under the Emperor Thsin-chi-hoang-ti (213 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>),
should sweep away all historical documents, language,
even in its most depraved state, would preserve the
secrets of the past, and would tell future generations
of the home and migrations of their ancestors from the
East to the West Indies.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may seem startling at first to find the same name,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the East Indies</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the West Indies</span></em>, at the two extremities
of the Aryan migrations; but these very names
are full of historical meaning. They tell us how the
Teutonic race, the most vigorous and enterprising of
all the members of the Aryan family, gave the name
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">West Indies</span></em> to the country which in their world-compassing
migrations they imagined to be India itself;
how they discovered their mistake and then distinguished
between the East Indies and West Indies;
how they planted new states in the west, and regenerated
the effete kingdoms in the east; how they
preached Christianity, and at last practised it by abolishing
slavery of body and mind among the slaves of
West-Indian landholders, and the slaves of Brahmanical
soulholders, till they greeted at last the very homes
from which the Aryan family had started when setting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out on their discovery of the world. All this, and
even more, may be read in the vast archives of language.
The very name of India has a story to tell,
for India is not a native name. We have it from the
Romans, the Romans from the Greeks, the Greeks from
the Persians. And why from the Persians? Because
it is only in Persian that an initial s is changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>,
which initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em> was as usual dropped in Greek. It is
only in Persian that the country of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sindhu</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sindhu</span></em>
is the Sanskrit name for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">river</span></em>), or of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven sindhus</span></em>,
could have been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hindia</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">India</span></em>
instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sindia</span></em>.
Unless the followers of Zoroaster had pronounced
every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>, we should never have heard of the West
Indies!

We have thus seen by an imaginary instance what
we must be prepared for in the growth of language,
and we shall now better understand why it must be
laid down as a fundamental principle in Comparative
Grammar to look upon nothing in language as
merely formal, till every attempt has been made to
trace the formal elements of language back to their
original and substantial prototypes. We are accustomed
to the idea of grammatical terminations modifying
the meaning of words. But words can be modified
by words only; and though in the present state of
our science it would be too much to say that all grammatical
terminations have been traced back to original
independent words, so many of them have, even in
cases where only a single letter was left, that we may
well lay it down as a rule that all formal elements of
language were originally substantial. Suppose English
had never been written down before the time of Piers
Ploughman. What should we make of such a form as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nadistou</span></em>,<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ne hadst thou</span></em>? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ne rechi</span></em> instead
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I reck not</span></em>? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Al ô'm</span></em> in Dorsetshire is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all of

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I could not</span></em>. Yet the
changes which Sanskrit had undergone before it was
reduced to writing, must have been more considerable
by far than what we see in these dialects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now look to modern classical languages such
as French and Italian. Most of the grammatical terminations
are the same as in Latin, only changed by
phonetic corruption. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'aime</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego amo</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tu
aimes</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tu amas</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">il aime</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ille amat</span></em>. There
was originally a final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></em> in French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">il aime</span></em>, and it comes out
again in such phrases as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aime-t-il?</span></em> Thus the French
imperfect corresponds to the Latin imperfect, the Parfait
défini to the Latin perfect. But what about the
French future? There is no similarity between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amabo</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'aimerai</span></em>. Here then we have a new grammatical
form, sprung up, as it were, within the recollection
of men; or, at least, in the broad daylight of history.
Now, did the termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rai</span></em> bud forth like a blossom
in spring? or did some wise people meet together to
invent this new termination, and pledge themselves to
use it instead of the old termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bo</span></em>? Certainly
not. We see first of all that in all the Romance
languages the terminations of the future are identical
with the auxiliary verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to have</span></em>.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> In French
you find—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">j'ai  and je chanter-ai   nous avons   and   nous chanterons.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">tu as and tu chanter-as   vous avez    and   vous chanterez.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">il a  and il chanter-a    ils ont      and   ils chanteront.</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But besides this, we actually find in Spanish and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Provençal the apparent termination of the future used
as an independent word and not yet joined to the infinitive.
We find in Spanish, instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lo hare</span></em>,”</span> I
shall do it, the more primitive form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hacer lo he</span></em>;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facere id habeo</span></em>. We find in Provençal, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dir vos ai</span></em> instead
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je vous dirai</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dir vos em</span></em> instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nous vous
dirons</span></em>. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the
Romance future was originally a compound of the auxiliary
verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to have</span></em> with an infinitive; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I have to say</span></em>,
easily took the meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I shall say</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, then, we see clearly how grammatical forms
arise. A Frenchman looks upon his futures as merely
grammatical forms. He has no idea, unless he is a
scholar, that the terminations of his futures are identical
with the auxiliary verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">avoir</span></em>. The Roman had no
suspicion that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amabo</span></em> was a compound; but it can be
proved to contain an auxiliary verb as clearly as the
French future. The Latin future was destroyed by
means of phonetic corruption. When the final letters
lost their distinct pronunciation it became impossible to
keep the imperfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amabam</span></em> separate from the future
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amabo</span></em>. The future was then replaced by dialectical regeneration,
for the use of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habeo</span></em> with an infinitive is found
in Latin, in such expressions as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habeo dicere</span></em>, I have to
say, which would imperceptibly glide into I shall
say.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>
In fact, wherever we look we see that, the future is
expressed by means of composition. We have in English
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I shall</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou wilt</span></em>, which mean originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I am
bound</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou intendest</span></em>. In German we use <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">werden</span></em>,
the Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vairthan</span></em>, which means originally to go, to
turn towards. In modern Greek we find thelō, I will,
in thelō dōsei, I shall give. In Roumansch we meet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vegnir</span></em>, to come, forming the future <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">veng a vegnir</span></em>,
I shall come; whereas in French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je viens de dire</span></em>, I
come from saying, is equivalent to <span class="tei tei-q">“I have just said.”</span>
The French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je vais dire</span></em> is almost a future, though
originally it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vado dicere</span></em>, I go to say. The Dorsetshire,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I be gwâin to goo a-pickèn stuones,”</span> is another
case in point. Nor is there any doubt that in
the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bo</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amabo</span></em> we have the old
auxiliary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bhû</span></em>, to
be, and in the Greek future in σω, the old auxiliary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></em>,
to be.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now go back another step, and ask the question
which we asked many times before, How can a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em>
produce so momentous a change as that from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I love</span></em> to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I loved</span></em>? As we have learnt in the meantime that
English goes back to Anglo-Saxon, and is closely related
to continental Saxon and Gothic, we look at once
to the Gothic imperfect in order to see whether it has
preserved any traces of the original compound; for,
after what we have seen in the previous cases, we
are no doubt prepared to find here, too, grammatical
terminations mere remnants of independent words.

with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dide</span></em> would not be very apparent. But here you
will perceive the advantage which Gothic has over all
other Teutonic dialects for the purposes of grammatical
comparison and analysis. It is in Gothic, and in Gothic

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dêdun</span></em> has been preserved. In the Gothic singular

Anglo-Saxon, not only in the singular but in the plural
also. Yet, such is the similarity between Gothic and
Anglo-Saxon that we cannot doubt their preterites
having been formed on the same last. If there be
any truth in inductive reasoning, there must have been
an original Anglo-Saxon preterite,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>

It might be asked, however, very properly, how <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em>
itself, or the Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dide</span></em>, was formed, and how it
received the meaning of a preterite. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dide</span></em> the final

that all preterites of old, or, as they are called, strong
verbs, were formed as in Greek and Sanskrit by means
of reduplication, reduplication being one of the principal
means by which roots were invested with a verbal
character.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> The root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> in Anglo-Saxon is the same

Now, in this manner, the whole, or nearly the whole,
grammatical framework of the Aryan or Indo-European
languages has been traced back to original independent
words, and even the slightest changes which at first
sight seem so mysterious, such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foot</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feet</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I
find</span></em> into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I found</span></em>, have been fully accounted for. This
is what is called comparative grammar, or a scientific
analysis of all the formal elements of a language preceded
by a comparison of all the varieties which one and
the same form has assumed in the numerous dialects of
the Aryan family. The most important dialects for
this purpose are Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Gothic;
but in many cases Zend, or Celtic, or Slavonic dialects
come in to throw an unexpected light on forms unintelligible
in any of the four principal dialects. The result
of such a work as Bopp's <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Grammar”</span>
of the Aryan languages may be summed up in a few
words. The whole framework of grammar—the elements
of derivation, declension, and conjugation—had
become settled before the separation of the Aryan
family. Hence the broad outlines of grammar, in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, Gothic, and the rest, are in reality
the same; and the apparent differences can be explained
by phonetic corruption, which is determined by the
phonetic peculiarities of each nation. On the whole,
the history of all the Aryan languages is nothing but a
gradual process of decay. After the grammatical terminations
of all these languages have been traced back
to their most primitive form, it is possible, in many instances,
to determine their original meaning. This,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, can be done by means of induction only; and
the period during which, as in the Provençal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dir vos ai</span></em>,
the component elements of the old Aryan grammar
maintained a separate existence in the language and
the mind of the Aryans had closed, before Sanskrit was
Sanskrit or Greek Greek. That there was such a
period we can doubt as little as we can doubt the real
existence of fern forests previous to the formation of
our coal fields. We can do even more. Suppose we
had no remnants of Latin; suppose the very existence
of Rome and of Latin were unknown to us; we might
still prove, on the evidence of the six Romance dialects,
that there must have been a time when these dialects
formed the language of a small settlement; nay, by
collecting the words which all these dialects share in
common, we might, to a certain extent, reconstruct the
original language, and draw a sketch of the state of
civilization, as reflected by these common words. The
same can be done if we compare Sanskrit, Greek, Latin,
Gothic, Celtic, and Slavonic. The words which have
as nearly as possible the same form and meaning in all
the languages must have existed before the people, who
afterwards formed the prominent nationalities of the
Aryan family, separated; and, if carefully interpreted,
they, too, will serve as evidence as to the state of civilization
attained by the Aryans before they left their
common home. It can be proved, by the evidence of
language, that before their separation the Aryans led
the life of agricultural nomads,—a life such as Tacitus
describes that of the ancient Germans. They knew the
arts of ploughing, of making roads, of building ships, of
weaving and sewing, of erecting houses; they had
counted at least as far as one hundred. They had domesticated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the most important animals, the cow, the
horse, the sheep, the dog; they were acquainted with
the most useful metals, and armed with iron hatchets,
whether for peaceful or warlike purposes. They had
recognized the bonds of blood and the bonds of marriage;
they followed their leaders and kings, and the
distinction between right and wrong was fixed by laws
and customs. They were impressed with the idea of
a divine Being, and they invoked it by various names.
All this, as I said, can be proved by the evidence of
language. For if you find that languages like Greek,
Latin, Gothic, Celtic, or Slavonic, which, after their
first separation, have had but little contact with Sanskrit,
have the same word, for instance, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iron</span></em> which
exists in Sanskrit, this is proof absolute that iron was
known previous to the Aryan separation. Now, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iron</span></em>
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ais</span></em> in Gothic, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ayas</span></em> in Sanskrit, a word which, as
it could not have been borrowed by the Indians from
the Germans or by the Germans from the Indians,
must have existed previous to their separation. We
could not find the same name for house in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, Slavonic, and Celtic,<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>
unless houses had
been known before the separation of these dialects. In
this manner a history of Aryan civilization has been
written from the archives of language, stretching back
to times far beyond the reach of any documentary
history.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The very name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arya</span></em> belongs to this history, and
I shall devote the rest of this lecture to tracing the
origin and gradual spreading of this old word. I had
intended to include, in to-day's lecture, a short account
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparative mythology</span></em>, a branch of our science which
restores the original form and meaning of decayed words
by the same means by which comparative grammar recovers
the original form and meaning of terminations.
But my time is too limited; and, as I have been asked
repeatedly why I applied the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aryan</span></em> to that
family of language which we have just examined, I feel
that I am bound to give an answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ârya</span></em> is a Sanskrit word, and in the later Sanskrit it
means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">noble</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of a good family</span></em>. It was, however, originally
a national name, and we see traces of it as late as
the Law-book of the Mânavas, where India is still
called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ârya-âvarta</span></em>, the abode of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Âryas</span></em>.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> In the
old Sanskrit, in the hymns of the Veda, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ârya</span></em> occurs
frequently as a national name and as a name of honor,
comprising the worshippers of the gods of the Brahmans,
as opposed to their enemies, who are called in
the Veda <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dasyus</span></em>. Thus one of the gods, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Indra</span></em>, who,
in some respects, answers to the Greek Zeus, is invoked
in the following words (Rigveda, i. 57, 8): <span class="tei tei-q">“Know thou
the Âryas, O Indra, and they who are Dasyus; punish
the lawless, and deliver them unto thy servant! Be
thou the mighty helper of the worshippers, and I will
praise all these thy deeds at the festivals.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the later dogmatic literature of the Vedic age,
the name of Ârya is distinctly appropriated to the
three first castes—the Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaiśyas—as
opposed to the fourth, or the Śûdras. In the
Śatapatha-Brâhmaņa it is laid down distinctly: <span class="tei tei-q">“Âryas
are only the Brahmans, the Kshatriyas, and Vaiśyas,
for they are admitted to the sacrifices. They shall not
speak with everybody, but only with the Brahman, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Kshatriya, and the Vaiśya. If they should fall into a
conversation with a Śûdra, let them say to another
man, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Tell this Śûdra so.’</span> This is the law.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Atharva-veda (iv. 20, 4; xix. 62, 1) expressions
occur such as, <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing all things, whether Śûdra
or Ârya,”</span> where Śûdra and Ârya are meant to express
the whole of mankind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ârya</span></em> with a long <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">â</span></em> is derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arya</span></em>
with a short <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>, and this name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arya</span></em> is applied in the
later Sanskrit to a Vaiśya, or a member of the third
caste.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>
What is called the third class must originally
have constituted the large majority of the Brahmanic
society, for all who were not soldiers or priests, were
Vaiśyas. We may well understand, therefore, how a
name, originally applied to the cultivators of the soil
and householders, should in time have become a general
name for all Aryans.<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> Why the householders
were called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arya</span></em> is a question which would carry us
too far at present. I can only state that the etymological
signification of Arya seems to be <span class="tei tei-q">“one who ploughs
or tills,”</span> and that it is connected with the root of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arare</span></em>.
The Aryans would seem to have chosen this name for
themselves as opposed to the nomadic races, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Turanians</span></em>,
whose original name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tura</span></em> implies the swiftness
of the horseman.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India, as we saw, the name of Ârya, as a national
name, fell into oblivion in later times, and was
preserved only in the term Âryâvarta, the abode of
the Aryans. But it was more faithfully preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the Zoroastrians who migrated from India to the
north-west, and whose religion has been preserved to
us in the Zend-avesta, though in fragments only. Now
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Airya</span></em> in Zend means venerable, and is at the same
time the name of the people.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> In the first chapter of
the Vendidád, where Ahuramazda explains to Zarathustra
the order in which he created the earth, sixteen
countries are mentioned, each, when created by
Ahuramazda, being pure and perfect; but each being
tainted in turn by Angro mainyus or Ahriman. Now
the first of these countries is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Airyanem vaêjô</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arianum semen</span></em>, the Aryan seed, and its position must
have been as far east as the western slopes of the Belurtag
and Mustag, near the sources of the Oxus and
Yaxartes, the highest elevation of Central
Asia.<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> From
this country, which is called their seed, the Aryans advanced
towards the south and west, and in the Zend-avesta
the whole extent of country occupied by the
Aryans is likewise called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Airyâ</span></em>. A line drawn from
India along the Paropamisus and Caucasus Indicus
in the east, following in the north the direction
between the Oxus and Yaxartes,<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> then running along
the Caspian Sea, so as to include Hyrcania and Râgha,
then turning south-east on the borders of Nisaea, Aria
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Haria), and the countries washed by the Etymandrus
and Arachotus, would indicate the general
horizon of the Zoroastrian world. It would be what
is called in the fourth cardé of the Yasht of Mithra,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the whole space of Aria,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vîśpem airyô-śayanem</span></em> (totum

Greek geographers use the name of Ariana
in a wider sense even than the Zend-avesta. All the
country between the Indian Ocean in the south and
the Indus in the east, the Hindu-kush and Paropamisus
in the north, the Caspian gates, Karamania, and
the mouth of the Persian gulf in the west, is included
by Strabo (xv. 2) under the name of Ariana; and
Bactria is thus called<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> by him <span class="tei tei-q">“the ornament of the
whole of Ariana.”</span> As the Zoroastrian religion spread
westward, Persia, Elymais, and Media all claimed for
themselves the Aryan title. Hellanicus, who wrote
before Herodotus, knows of Aria as a name of
Persia.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>
Herodotus (vii. 62) attests that the Medians called
themselves Arii; and even for Atropatene, the northernmost
part of Media, the name of Ariania (not Aria)
has been preserved by Stephanus Byzantinus. As to
Elymais its name has been derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ailama</span></em>, a
supposed corruption of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Airyama</span></em>.<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> The Persians, Medians,
Bactrians, and Sogdians all spoke, as late as the

time of Strabo,<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a> nearly the same language, and we
may well understand, therefore, that they should have
claimed for themselves one common name, in opposition
to the hostile tribes of Turan.

That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aryan</span></em> was used as a title of honor in the Persian

an Aryan and of Aryan descent; and Ahuramazda,

rendered in the Turanian translation of the inscription

Along the Caspian, and in the country washed by
the Oxus and Yaxartes, Aryan and non-Aryan tribes
were mingled together for centuries. Though the relation
between Aryans and Turanians is hostile, and
though there were continual wars between them, as we
learn from the great Persian epic, the Shahnámeh, it
does not follow that all the nomad races who infested
the settlements of the Aryans, were of Tatar blood
and speech. Turvaśa and his descendants, who represent
the Turanians, are described in the later epic
poems of India as cursed and deprived of their inheritance
in India. But in the Vedas Turvaśa is represented
as worshipping Aryan gods. Even in the Shahnámeh,
Persian heroes go over to the Turanians and
lead them against Iran, very much as Coriolanus led
the Samnites against Rome. We may thus understand
why so many Turanian or Scythian names, mentioned
by Greek writers, should show evident traces of Aryan
origin. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aspa</span></em> was the Persian name for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">horse</span></em>, and in
the Scythian names <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aspabota</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aspakara</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Asparatha</span></em>,<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a>
we can hardly fail to recognize the same element.
Even the name of the Aspasian mountains, placed by
Ptolemy in Scythia, indicates a similar origin. Nor is
the word Arya unknown beyond the Oxus. There is
a people called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ariacœ</span></em>,<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> another called

king of the Scythians, at the time of Darius, was called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ariantes</span></em>. A cotemporary of Xerxes is known by the
name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aripithes</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
Sanskrit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aryapati</span></em>; Zend, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">airyapaiti</span></em>);
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spargapithes</span></em> seems to have some connection
with the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">svargapati</span></em>, lord of heaven.

We have thus traced the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ârya</span></em> from India
to the west, from Âryâvarta to Ariana, Persia, Media,
more doubtfully to Armenia and Albania, to the Iron
in the Caucasus, and to some of the nomad tribes in
Transoxiana. As we approach Europe the traces of
this name grow fainter, yet they are not altogether
lost.

Two roads were open to the Aryans of Asia in their
westward migrations. One through Chorasan<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> to the
north, through what is now called Russia, and thence
to the shores of the Black Sea and Thrace. Another
from Armenia, across the Caucasus or across the Black
Sea to Northern Greece, and along the Danube to
Germany. Now on the former road the Aryans left a
trace of their migration in the old name of Thrace
which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aria</span></em>;<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> on the latter we meet in the eastern
part of Germany, near the Vistula, with a German
tribe called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arii</span></em>. And as in Persia we found many
proper names in which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arya</span></em> formed an important ingredient,
so we find again in German history names
such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ariovistus</span></em>.<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>

Though we look in vain for any traces of this old
national name among the Greeks and Romans, late
researches have rendered it at least plausible that it has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been preserved in the extreme west of the Aryan migrations,
in the very name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></em>. The common
etymology of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Erin</span></em> is that it means <span class="tei tei-q">“island of the west,”</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iar-innis</span></em>, or land of the west, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iar-in</span></em>. But this is clearly

The old name is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ériu</span></em> in the nominative, more
recently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Éire</span></em>. It is only in the oblique cases that the

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regionis</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Erin</span></em> therefore
has been explained as a derivative of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Er</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eri</span></em>, said
to be the ancient name of the Irish Celts as preserved

It is maintained by O'Reilly, though denied by others,
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">er</span></em> is used in Irish in the sense of noble, like the

Some of the evidence here collected in tracing the
ancient name of the Aryan family, may seem doubtful,
and I have pointed out myself some links of the chain
uniting the earliest name of India with the modern
name of Ireland, as weaker than the rest. But the
principal links are safe. Names of countries, peoples,
rivers, and mountains, have an extraordinary vitality,
and they will remain while cities, kingdoms, and nations
pass away. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></em> has the same name to-day, and
will probably have it forever, which was given to it by
the earliest Latin and Sabine settlers, and wherever we
find the name of Rome, whether in Wallachia, which
by the inhabitants is called Rumania, or in the dialects
of the Grisons, the Romansch, or in the title of the
Romance languages, we know that some threads would
lead us back to the Rome of Romulus and Remus, the
stronghold of the earliest warriors of Latium. The
ruined city near the mouth of the Upper Zab, now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
usually known by the name of Nimrud, is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Athur</span></em>
by the Arabic geographers, and in Athur we recognize
the old name of Assyria, which Dio Cassius writes Atyria,
remarking that the barbarians changed the Sigma
into Tau. Assyria is called Athurâ, in the inscriptions
of Darius.<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> We hear of battles fought on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sutledge</span></em>,
and we hardly think that the battle field of the Sikhs
was nearly the same where Alexander fought the kings
of the Penjáb. But the name of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sutledge</span></em> is the
name of the same river as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hesudrus</span></em> of Alexander,
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Śatadru</span></em> of the Indians, and among the oldest
hymns of the Veda, about 1500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>, we find a war-song
referring to a battle fought on the two banks of
the same river.

No doubt there is danger in trusting to mere similarity
of names. Grimm may be right that the Arii of
Tacitus were originally Harii, and that their name is
not connected with Ârya. But the evidence on either
side being merely conjectural, this must remain an open
question. In most cases, however, a strict observation
of the phonetic laws peculiar to each language will remove
all uncertainty. Grimm, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“History of the
German Language”</span> (p. 228), imagined that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hariva</span></em>,
the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Herat</span></em> in the cuneiform inscriptions, is connected
with Arii, the name which, as we saw, Herodotus
gives to the Medes. This cannot be, for the initial
aspiration in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hariva</span></em> points to a word which in Sanskrit
begins with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, and not with a vowel, like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ârya</span></em>. The
following remarks will make this clearer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Herat is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Herat</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Heri</span></em>,<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> and the river on

is called by Ptolemy Ἀρείας,<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> by other writers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arius</span></em>;
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aria</span></em> is the name given to the country between
Parthia (Parthuwa) in the west, Margiana (Marghush)
in the north, Bactria (Bakhtrish) and Arachosia
(Harauwatish) in the east, and Drangiana (Zaraka)
in the south. This, however, though without the
initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>, is not Ariana, as described by Strabo, but an
independent country, forming part of it. It is supposed
to be the same as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Haraiva</span></em> (Hariva) of the
cuneiform inscriptions, though this is doubtful. But it
is mentioned in the Zend-avesta, under the name of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Harôyu</span></em>,<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> as the sixth country created by Ormuzd. We
can trace this name with the initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em> even beyond the
time of Zoroaster. The Zoroastrians were a colony
from northern India. They had been together for a
time with the people whose sacred songs have been
preserved to us in the Veda. A schism took place,
and the Zoroastrians migrated westward to Arachosia
and Persia. In their migrations they did what the
Greeks did when they founded new colonies, what
the Americans did in founding new cities. They
gave to the new cities and to the rivers along which
they settled, the names of cities and rivers familiar to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them, and reminding them of the localities which they
had left. Now, as a Persian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em> points to a Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Harôyu</span></em> would be in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Saroyu</span></em>. One of the sacred
rivers of India, a river mentioned in the Veda, and
famous in the epic poems as the river of Ayodhyâ, one
of the earliest capitals of India, the modern Oude, has
the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sarayu</span></em>, the modern
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sardju</span></em>.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>

As Comparative Philology has thus traced the ancient
name of Ârya from India to Europe, as the original
title assumed by the Aryans before they left their common
home, it is but natural that it should have been
chosen as the technical term for the family of languages
which was formerly designated as Indo-Germanic,
Indo-European, Caucasian, or Japhetic.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our analysis of some of the nominal and verbal
formations in the Aryan or Indo-European family of
speech has taught us that, however mysterious and
complicated these grammatical forms appear at first
sight, they are in reality the result of a very simple
process. It seems at first almost hopeless to ask such
questions as why the addition of a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em> should
change love present into love past, or why the termination
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ai</span></em> in French, if added to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aimer</span></em>, should convey
the idea of love to come. But, once placed under
the microscope of comparative grammar, these and all
other grammatical forms assume a very different and
much more intelligible aspect. We saw how what
we now call terminations were originally independent
words. After coalescing with the words which they
were intended to modify, they were gradually reduced
to mere syllables and letters, unmeaning in themselves,
yet manifesting their former power and independence
by the modification which they continue to produce in
the meaning of the words to which they are appended.
The true nature of grammatical terminations was first
pointed out by a philosopher, who, however wild some
of his speculations may be, had certainly caught many
a glimpse of the real life and growth of language, I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Horne Tooke</span></em>. This is what he writes
of terminations:<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For though I think I have good reasons to believe
that all terminations may likewise be traced to their
respective origin; and that, however artificial they
may now appear to us, they were not originally the
effect of premeditated and deliberate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">art</span></em>, but separate
words by length of time corrupted and coalescing with
the words of which they are now considered as the
terminations. Yet this was less likely to be suspected
by others. And if it had been suspected, they would
have had much further to travel to their journey's end,
and through a road much more embarrassed; as the
corruption in those languages is of much longer standing
than in ours, and more complex.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Horne Tooke, however, though he saw rightly what
road should be followed to track the origin of grammatical
terminations, was himself without the means to
reach his journey's end. Most of his explanations
are quite untenable, and it is curious to observe in
reading his book, the Diversions of Purley, how a man
of a clear, sharp, and powerful mind, and reasoning
according to sound and correct principles, may yet,
owing to his defective knowledge of facts, arrive at
conclusions directly opposed to truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we have once seen how grammatical terminations
are to be traced back in the beginning to independent
words, we have learnt at the same time that
the component elements of language, which remain in
our crucible at the end of a complete grammatical
analysis, are of two kinds, namely, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Roots predicative</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Roots demonstrative</span></em>.
</p>

We call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">root</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">radical</span></em>, whatever, in the words of
any language or family of languages, cannot be reduced
to a simpler or more original form. It may be well to
illustrate this by a few examples. But, instead of taking
a number of words in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin,
and tracing them back to their common centre, it will
be more instructive if we begin with a root which has
been discovered, and follow it through its wanderings
from language to language. I take the root AR, to
which I alluded in our last Lecture as the source of
the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Arya</span></em>, and we shall thus, while examining its
ramification, learn at the same time why that name
was chosen by the agricultural nomads, the ancestors
of the Aryan race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This root AR<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to plough</span></em>, to open the soil.
From it we have the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar-are</span></em>, the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar-oun</span></em>,
the Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em>, the Lithuanian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar-ti</span></em>,
the Russian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ora-ti</span></em>,

<span class="tei tei-q">“to ear the land that has some hope to grow.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this we have the name of the plough, or the
instrument of earing: in Latin, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ara-trum</span></em>; in Greek,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aro-tron</span></em>; in Bohemian, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oradto</span></em>; in Lithuanian,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arklas</span></em>; in Cornish, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aradar</span></em>; in Welsh,

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ardhr</span></em>. In Old Norse, however, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ardhr</span></em>, meaning originally
the plough, came to mean earnings or wealth; the
plough being, in early times, the most essential possession
of the peasant. In the same manner the Latin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
name for money, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pecunia</span></em>, was derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pecus</span></em>, cattle;
the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fee</span></em>, which is now restricted to the payment
made to a doctor or lawyer, was in Old English
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feh</span></em>, and in Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feoh</span></em>, meaning cattle and
wealth; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feoh</span></em>, and Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faihu</span></em>, are really the same
word as the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pecus</span></em>, the modern German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vieh</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The act of ploughing is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aratio</span></em> in Latin; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arosis</span></em>
in Greek: and I believe that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arôma</span></em>, in the sense of
perfume, had the same origin; for what is sweeter or
more aromatic than the smell of a ploughed field? In
Genesis, xxviii. 27, Jacob says <span class="tei tei-q">“the smell of my son
is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more primitive formation of the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> seems to
be the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">era</span></em>, earth, the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">irâ</span></em>, the Old High-German
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ëro</span></em>, the Gaelic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ire</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">irionn</span></em>. It meant originally
the ploughed land, afterwards earth in general. Even
the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earth</span></em>, the Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">airtha</span></em>,<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> the Anglo-Saxon
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eorthe</span></em>, must have been taken originally in the sense
of ploughed or cultivated land. The derivative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar-mentum</span></em>,
formed like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ju-mentum</span></em>, would naturally have
been applied to any animal fit for ploughing and other
labor in the field, whether ox or horse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As agriculture was the principal labor in that early
state of society when we must suppose most of our
Aryan words to have been formed and applied to their
definite meanings, we may well understand how a word
which originally meant this special kind of labor, was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
afterwards used to signify labor in general. The general
tendency in the growth of words and their meanings
is from the special to the more general: thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gubernare</span></em>, which originally meant to steer a ship, took
the general sense of governing. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To equip</span></em>, which
originally was to furnish a ship (French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">équiper</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esquif</span></em>, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">schifo</span></em>, ship), came to mean furnishing in
general. Now in modern German, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbeit</span></em> means simply
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">labor</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbeitsam</span></em> means industrious. In Gothic,
too, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbaiþs</span></em> is only used to express labor and trouble
in general. But in Old Norse, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">erfidhi</span></em> means chiefly
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ploughing</span></em>, and afterwards labor in general; and the
same word in Anglo-Saxon, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earfodh</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earfedhe</span></em>, is labor.
Of course we might equally suppose that, as laborer,
from meaning one who labors in general, came to take
the special sense of an agricultural laborer, so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbeit</span></em>,
from meaning work in general, came to be applied, in
Old Norse, to the work of ploughing. But as the root
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">erfidhi</span></em> seems to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em>, our first explanation is the
more plausible. Besides, the simple <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> in Old Norse
means ploughing and labor, and the Old High-German
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">art</span></em> has likewise the sense of ploughing.<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ἄρουρα and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arvum</span></em>, a field, would certainly have to
be referred to the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em>, to plough. And as ploughing
was not only one of the earliest kinds of labor, but
also one of the most primitive arts, I have no doubt
that the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ars</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artis</span></em>, and our own word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">art</span></em>,
meant originally the art of all arts, first taught to mortals by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the goddess of all wisdom, the art of cultivating the
land. In Old High-German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arunti</span></em>, in Anglo-Saxon
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ærend</span></em>, mean simply work; but they too must originally
have meant the special work of agriculture; and in the
English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">errand</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">errand-boy</span></em>, the same word is still
in existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> did not only mean to plough, or to cut open
the land; it was transferred at a very early time to the
ploughing of the sea, or rowing. Thus Shakspeare
says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a similar manner, we find that Sanskrit derives
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> the substantive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aritra</span></em>, not in the sense of a
plough, but in the sense of a rudder. In Anglo-Saxon
we find the simple form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âr</span></em>, the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oar</span></em>, as it were
the plough-share of the water. The Greek also had
used the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> in the sense of rowing; for
ἐρέτης<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> in
Greek is a rower, and their word τρι-ήρ-ης, meant originally
a ship with three oars, or with three rows of
oars,<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> a trireme.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This comparison of ploughing and rowing is of frequent
occurrence in ancient languages. The English
word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plough</span></em>, the Slavonic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ploug</span></em>, has been identified
with the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plava</span></em>,<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> a ship, and with the Greek
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ploion</span></em>, ship. As the Aryans spoke of a ship ploughing
the sea, they also spoke of a plough sailing across
the field; and thus it was that the same names were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
applied to both.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>
In English dialects, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plough</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plow</span></em>
is still used in the general sense of waggon or conveyance.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We might follow the offshoots of this root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> still
further, but the number of words which we have examined
in various languages will suffice to show
what is meant by a predicative root. In all these
words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> is the radical element, all the rest is merely
formative. The root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em> is called a predicative root,
because in whatever composition it enters, it predicates
one and the same conception, whether of the plough,
or the rudder, or the ox, or the field. Even in such
a word as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artistic</span></em>, the predicative power of the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ar</span></em>
may still be perceived, though, of course, as it were by
means of a powerful telescope only. The Brahmans
who called themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ârya</span></em> in India, were no more
aware of the real origin of this name and its connection
with agricultural labor, than the artist who now
speaks of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his art</span></em> as a divine inspiration suspects that
the word which he uses was originally applicable only
to so primitive an art as that of ploughing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall now examine another family of words, in
order to see by what process the radical elements of
words were first discovered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us take the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectable</span></em>. It is a word of
Latin not of Saxon, origin, as we see by the termination
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">able</span></em>. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectabilis</span></em> we easily distinguish the verb
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectare</span></em> and the termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bilis</span></em>. We then separate
the prefix <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">re</span></em>, which leaves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spectare</span></em>, and we trace
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spectare</span></em> as a participial formation back to the Latin verb
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spicere</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, meaning to see, to look. In
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, again, we distinguish between the changeable termination
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ere</span></em> and the unchangeable remnant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spec</span></em>, which we
call the root. This root we expect to find in Sanskrit
and the other Aryan languages; and so we do. In
Sanskrit the more usual form is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paś</span></em>, to see, without the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>; but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spaś</span></em> also is found in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spaśa</span></em>, a spy, in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spashṭa</span></em> (in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vi-spashṭa</span></em>), clear, manifest, and in the Vedic
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spaś</span></em>, a guardian. In the Teutonic family we find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spëhôn</span></em> in
Old High-German meaning to look, to spy, to contemplate;
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spëha</span></em>, the English spy.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> In Greek, the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spek</span></em> has
been changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skep</span></em>, which exists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skeptomai</span></em>,
I look, I examine; from whence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skeptikos</span></em>, an
examiner or inquirer, in theological language, a sceptic;
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">episkopos</span></em>, an overseer, a bishop. Let us now examine
the various ramifications of this root. Beginning
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectable</span></em>, we found that it originally meant a
person who deserves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em> meaning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">looking
back</span></em>. We pass by common objects or persons without
noticing them, whereas we turn back to look again at
those which deserve our admiration, our regard, our
respect. This was the original meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectable</span></em>, nor need we be surprised at this if we consider
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">noble</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nobilis</span></em> in Latin, conveyed originally
no more than the idea of a person that deserves to be
known; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nobilis</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gnobilis</span></em>, just as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span></em>
stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gnomen</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natus</span></em> for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gnatus</span></em>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“With respect to”</span> has now become almost a mere
preposition. For if we say, <span class="tei tei-q">“With respect to this
point I have no more to say,”</span> this is the same as <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have no more to say on this point.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, as in looking back we single out a person,
the adjective <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respective</span></em>, and the adverb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectively</span></em>,
are used almost in the same sense as special, or singly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respite</span></em> is the Norman modification of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectus</span></em>, the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">répit</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Répit</span></em> meant originally
looking back, reviewing the whole evidence. A criminal
received so many days <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ad respectum</span></em>, to re-examine
the case. Afterwards it was said that the prisoner had
received a respit, that is to say, had obtained a re-examination;
and at last a verb was formed, and it was
said that a person had been respited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, to see, with the preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">re</span></em>, came to
mean respect, so with the preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de</span></em>, down, it forms
the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despicere</span></em>, meaning to look down, the English
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despise</span></em>. The French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dépit</span></em> (Old French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despit</span></em>) means
no longer contempt, though it is the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despectus</span></em>,
but rather <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anger</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vexation</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Se dépiter</span></em> is to be
vexed, to fret. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">En dépit de lui</span></em>”</span> is originally <span class="tei tei-q">“angry with
him,”</span> then <span class="tei tei-q">“in spite of him;”</span> and the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spite</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in spite of</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiteful</span></em>, are mere abbreviations
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despite</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
despite of</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">despiteful</span></em>, and have nothing whatever to do
with the spitting of cats.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">de</span></em> means down from above, so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sub</span></em> means up from
below, and this added to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, to look, gives us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicere</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicari</span></em>, to look up, in the sense of to
suspect.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>
From it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicion</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicious</span></em>; and likewise the French
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soupçon</span></em>, even in such phrases as <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a soupçon
of chicory in this coffee,”</span> meaning just a touch, just
the smallest atom of chicory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">circum</span></em> means round about, so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">circumspect</span></em> means,
of course, cautious, careful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, meaning into, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em> forms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspicere</span></em>, to
inspect; hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspector</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspection</span></em>.

look at a thing. Hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adspectus</span></em>, the aspect, the look or
appearance of things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pro</span></em>, forward, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em> became <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prospicere</span></em>;
and gave rise to such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prospectus</span></em>, as it were a
look out, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prospective</span></em>, &amp;c. With <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">con</span></em>, with,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spicere</span></em> forms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conspicere</span></em>, to see together,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conspectus</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conspicuous</span></em>. We
saw before in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respectable</span></em>, that a new word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spectare</span></em> is
formed from the participle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spicere</span></em>. This, with the
preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ex</span></em>, out, gives us the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expectare</span></em>, the
English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to expect</span></em>, to look out; with its derivatives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Auspicious</span></em> is another word which contains our root
as the second of its component elements. The Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">auspicium</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">avispicium</span></em>, and meant the looking
out for certain birds which were considered to be
of good or bad omen to the success of any public or
private act. Hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">auspicious</span></em>, in the sense of lucky.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Haru-spex</span></em> was the name given to a person who foretold

Again, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculum</span></em> was formed, in the

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculative</span></em>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are many more offshoots of this one root.
Thus, the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculum</span></em>, looking-glass, became <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specchio</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Italian; and the same word, though in a roundabout
way, came into French as the adjective <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">espiègle</span></em>,
waggish. The origin of this French word is curious.
There exists in German a famous cycle of stories,
mostly tricks, played by a half-historical, half-mythical
character of the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eulenspiegel</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Owl-glass</span></em>.
These stories were translated into French, and the hero
was known at first by the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ulespiègle</span></em>, which
name, contracted afterwards into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Espiègle</span></em>, became a
general name for every wag.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the French borrowed not only from Latin, but
likewise from the Teutonic languages, we meet there
side by side with the derivatives of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>,
the old High-German, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spëhôn</span></em>, slightly disguised as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">épier</span></em>,
to spy, the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiare</span></em>. The German word for a
spy was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spëha</span></em>, and this appears in old French as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">espie</span></em>,
in modern French as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">espion</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most prolific branches of the same root
is the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>. Whether we take <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em> in the
sense of a perennial succession of similar individuals
in continual generations (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jussieu</span></em>), or look upon it
as existing only as a category of thought (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Agassiz</span></em>),
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em> was intended originally as the literal translation
of the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eidos</span></em> as opposed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genos</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></em>.
The Greeks classified things originally according to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kind</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>, and though these terms were afterwards
technically defined by Aristotle, their etymological
meaning is in reality the most appropriate.
Things may be classified either because they are of
the same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kind</span></em>, that is to say, because they
had the same origin; this gives us a genealogical classification:
or they can be classified because they have
the same appearance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eidos</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>, without claiming
for them a common origin; and this gives us a morphological
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
classification. It was, however, in the Aristotelian,
and not in its etymological sense, that the
Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eidos</span></em> was rendered in Latin by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, meaning
the subdivision of a genus, the class of a family.
Hence the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">espèce</span></em>, a kind; the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special</span></em>,
in the sense of particular as opposed to general. There
is little of the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spaś</span></em>, to see, left in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special train</span></em>,
or a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special messenger</span></em>; yet the connection, though not
apparent, can be restored with perfect certainty. We
frequently hear the expression <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to specify</span></em>. A man
specifies his grievances. What does it mean? The
mediæval Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specificus</span></em> is a literal translation of the
Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eidopoios</span></em>. This means what makes or constitutes
an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eidos</span></em> or species. Now, in classification, what
constitutes a species is that particular quality which,
superadded to other qualities, shared in common by
all the members of a genus, distinguishes one class
from all other classes. Thus the specific character
which distinguishes man from all other animals, is
reason or language. Specific, therefore, assumed the sense of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinguishing</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct</span></em>, and the verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to specify</span></em>
conveyed the meaning of enumerating distinctly,
or one by one. I finish with the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">épicier</span></em>, a
respectable grocer, but originally a man who sold
drugs. The different kinds of drugs which the apothecary
had to sell, were spoken of, with a certain learned
air, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, not as drugs in general, but as peculiar
drugs and special medicines. Hence the chymist or
apothecary is still called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Speziale</span></em> in Italian, his shop
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spezieria</span></em>.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> In French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, which regularly became
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">espèce</span></em>, assumed a new form to express drugs, namely
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">épices</span></em>; the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spices</span></em>, the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spezereien</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hence the famous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pain d'épices</span></em>, gingerbread nuts, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">épicier</span></em>, a grocer. If you try for a moment to trace
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spicy</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a well-spiced</span></em> article, back to the simple root
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specere</span></em>, to look, you will understand that marvellous
power of language which out of a few simple elements
has created a variety of names hardly surpassed by the
unbounded variety of nature herself.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a>

The primary roots are the most important in the
early history of language; but their predicative power
being generally of too indefinite a character to answer
the purposes of advancing thought, they were soon encroached
upon and almost supplanted by secondary and
tertiary radicals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the secondary roots we can frequently observe
that one of the consonants, in the Aryan languages,
generally the final, is liable to modification. The root
retains its general meaning, which is slightly modified
and determined by the changes of the final consonants.
Thus, besides <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tud</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tudati</span></em>), we have in Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tup</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">topati</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tupati</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tumpati</span></em>),
meaning to strike; Greek, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">typ-tō</span></em>. We meet likewise with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tubh</span></em>
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tubhnâti</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tubhyati</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tobhate</span></em>), to strike; and, according to Sanskrit grammarians, with

Then there is a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tuj</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tunjati</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tojati</span></em>), to
strike, to excite;
another root, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tur</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tutorti</span></em>), to which the same meaning
is ascribed; another, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tûr</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tûryate</span></em>), to hurt. Then
there is the further derivative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">turv</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tûrvati</span></em>), to strike,
to conquer; there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tuh</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tohati</span></em>), to pain, to vex; and
there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tuś</span></em> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tośate</span></em>), to which Sanskrit grammarians
attribute the sense of striking.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although we may call all these verbal bases roots,
they stand to the first class in about the same relation
as the triliteral Semitic roots to the more primitive
biliteral.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>

In the third class we shall find that one of the two
consonants is always a semivowel, nasal, or sibilant,
these being more variable than the other consonants;
and we can almost always point to one consonant as
of later origin, and added to a biconsonantal root in
order to render its meaning more special. Thus we
have, besides <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spaś</span></em>, the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paś</span></em>, and even this root
has been traced back by Pott to a more primitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aś</span></em>.
Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vand</span></em>, again, is a mere strengthening of the root
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vad</span></em>, like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mand</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mad</span></em>, like
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu-na-j</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu-n-j</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yuj</span></em>.
The root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yuj</span></em>, to join, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yudh</span></em>, to fight, both point
back to a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu</span></em>, to mingle, and this simple root has
been preserved in Sanskrit. We may well understand
that a root, having the general meaning of mingling or
being together, should be employed to express both the
friendly joining of hands and the engaging in hostile
combat; but we may equally understand that language,
in its progress to clearness and definiteness,
should have desired a distinction between these two
meanings, and should gladly have availed herself of
the two derivatives, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yuj</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yudh</span></em>, to mark this distinction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sanskrit grammarians have reduced the whole
growth of their language to 1706 roots,<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> that is to
say, they have admitted so many radicals in order to
derive from them, according to their system of grammatical
derivation, all nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns,
prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
occur in Sanskrit. According to our explanation of
a root, however, this number of 1706 would have
to be reduced considerably, and though a few new
roots would likewise have to be added which Sanskrit
grammarians failed to discover, yet the number
of primitive sounds, expressive of definite meanings,
requisite for the etymological analysis of the whole
Sanskrit dictionary would not amount to even one
third of that number. Hebrew has been reduced to
about 500 roots,<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> and I doubt whether we want a
larger number for Sanskrit. This shows a wise
spirit of economy on the part of primitive language,
for the possibility of forming new roots for every
new impression was almost unlimited. Even if we
put the number of letters only at twenty-four, the
possible number of biliteral and triliteral roots would
amount together to 14,400; whereas Chinese, though
abstaining from composition and derivation, and therefore
requiring a larger number of radicals than any
other language, was satisfied with about 450. With
these 450 sounds raised to 1263 by various accents and
intonations, the Chinese have produced a dictionary of
from 40,000 to 50,000 words.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>

It is clear, however, that in addition to these predicative
roots, we want another class of radical elements
to enable us to account for the full growth of language.
With the 400 or 500 predicative roots at her disposal,
language would not have been at a loss to coin names
for all things that come under our cognizance. Language
is a thrifty housewife. Consider the variety

you will see that with 500 such roots she might form a
dictionary sufficient to satisfy the wants, however extravagant,
of her husband—the human mind. If
each root yielded fifty derivatives, we should have
25,000 words. Now, we are told, on good authority,

eloquent speakers may rise to a command of 10,000.

Five hundred roots, therefore, considering their fertility
and pliancy, was more than was wanted for the
dictionary of our primitive ancestors. And yet they
wanted something more. If they had a root expressive
of light and splendor, that root might have formed
the predicate in the names of sun, and moon, and stars,
and heaven, day, morning, dawn, spring, gladness, joy,
beauty, majesty, love, friend, gold, riches, &amp;c. But if
they wanted to express <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>,

these words back to predicative roots; but if we are
told that the demonstrative root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em>, this or there, may
be derived from a predicative root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tan</span></em>, to extend, we
find that even in our modern languages, the demonstrative
pronouns and particles are of too primitive and
independent a nature to allow of so artificial an interpretation.
The sound <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sa</span></em>, for this or there, is as involuntary,
as natural, as independent an expression as any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the predicative roots, and although some of these demonstrative,
or pronominal, or local roots, for all these
names have been applied to them, may be traced back
to a predicative source, we must admit a small class of
independent radicals, not predicative in the usual sense
of the word, but simply pointing, simply expressive of
existence under certain more or less definite, local or
temporal prescriptions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be best to give one illustration at least of a
pronominal root and its influence in the formation of
words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In some languages, and particularly in Chinese, a
predicative root may by itself be used as a noun, or
a verb, or an adjective or adverb. Thus the Chinese
sound <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em> means, without any change of form, great,
greatness, and to be great.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> If <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em> stands before a
substantive, it has the meaning of an adjective. Thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta jin</span></em> means a great man. If <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em> stands after a substantive,
it is a predicate, or, as we should say, a
verb. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jin ta</span></em> (or jin ta ye) would mean the
man is great.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> Or again,
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">ģin ngŏ, li pŭ ngŏ,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">would mean,  man    bad,  law  not   bad.</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we see that there is no outward distinction whatever
between a root and a word, and that a noun is
distinguished from a verb merely by its collocation in
a sentence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In other languages, however, and particularly in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Aryan languages, no predicative root can by itself form
a word. Thus in Latin there is a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">luc</span></em>, to shine. In
order to have a substantive, such as light, it was necessary
to add a pronominal or demonstrative root, this
forming the general subject of which the meaning contained
in the root is to be predicated. Thus by the
addition of the pronominal element <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> we have the
Latin noun, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">luc-s</span></em>, the light, or literally, shining-there.
Let us add a personal pronoun, and we have the verb
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">luc-e-s</span></em>, shining-thou, thou shinest. Let us add other
pronominal derivatives, and we get the adjectives, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lucidus</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">luculentus</span></em>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be a totally mistaken view, however, were
we to suppose that all derivative elements, all that remains
of a word after the predicative root has been removed,
must be traced back to pronominal roots. We
have only to look at some of our own modern derivatives
in order to be convinced that many of them were
originally predicative, that they entered into composition
with the principal predicative root, and then dwindled
down to mere suffixes. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scape</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">landscape</span></em>,
and the more modern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ship</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hardship</span></em> are both derived
from the same root which we have in Gothic,<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skapa</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skôp</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skôpum</span></em>, to create; in Anglo-Saxon, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scape</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scôp</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scôpon</span></em>. It is the same as the German derivative,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">schaft</span></em>, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gesellschaft</span></em>, &amp;c. So again
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dom</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wisdom</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">christendom</span></em>
is derived from the same root which we have in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to do</span></em>. It is the same as the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thum</span></em>
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christenthum</span></em>,
the Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dôm</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cyning-dom</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Königthum</span></em>.
Sometimes it may seem doubtful whether a derivative
element was originally merely demonstrative or predicative.
Thus the termination of the comparative in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sanskrit is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tara</span></em>, the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teros</span></em>. This might, at first
sight, be taken for a demonstrative element, but it is in
reality the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tar</span></em>, which means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to go beyond</span></em>, which
we have likewise in the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trans</span></em>. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trans</span></em> in its
French form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">très</span></em> is prefixed to adjectives in order to
express a higher or transcendent degree, and the same
root was well adapted to form the comparative in the
ancient Aryan tongues. This root must likewise be
admitted in one of the terminations of the locative
which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tra</span></em> in Sanskrit; for instance from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em>, a demonstrative
root, we form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta-tra</span></em>, there, originally this
way; we form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anyatra</span></em>, in another way; the same as
in Latin we say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ali-ter</span></em>, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aliud</span></em>; compounds no
more surprising than the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">autrement</span></em> (see p. 55)
and the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">otherwise</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the terminations of declension and conjugation
are demonstrative roots, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, for instance, of
the third person singular, he loves, can be proved to
have been originally the demonstrative pronoun of the
third person. It was originally not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></em>. This will
require some explanation. The termination of the third
person singular of the present is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em> in Sanskrit. Thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dâ</span></em>, to give, becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadâti</span></em>, he gives; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dhâ</span></em>, to
place, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadhâti</span></em>, he places.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Greek this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em> is changed into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">si</span></em>; just as the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tvam</span></em>, the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tu</span></em>, thou, appears in Greek as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sy</span></em>.
Thus Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">didōsi</span></em> corresponds to Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadâti</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tithēsi</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadhâti</span></em>. In the course of time, however,
every Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> between two vowels, in a termination,
was elided. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genos</span></em> does not form the genitive
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genesos</span></em>, like the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genesis</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generis</span></em>, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">geneos</span></em> = <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genous</span></em>. The dative is not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genesi</span></em> (the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generi</span></em>), but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">geneï</span></em> =
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genei</span></em>. In the same manner all the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regular verbs have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></em> for the termination of the third
person singular. But this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esi</span></em>. Thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">typtei</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">typtesi</span></em>, and this for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">typteti</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Latin drops the final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em>, and instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em> has
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></em>.
Thus we get <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amat</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dicit</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now there is a law to which I alluded before, which
is called Grimm's Law. According to it every tenuis
in Latin is in Gothic represented by its corresponding
aspirate. Hence, instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></em>, we should expect in
Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">th</span></em>; and so we find indeed in Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habaiþ</span></em>,
instead of Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habet</span></em>. This aspirate likewise appears
in Anglo-Saxon, where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he loves</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lufað</span></em>. It is preserved
in the Biblical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he loveth</span></em>, and it is only in modern English
that it gradually sank to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he loves</span></em>,
therefore, we have a demonstrative root, added to the
predicative root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love</span></em>, and this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> is originally the same
as the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em>. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em> again must be traced back
to the demonstrative root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em>, this or there; which exists
in the Sanskrit demonstrative pronoun <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tad</span></em>, the Greek
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></em>, the Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thata</span></em>, the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>; and which
in Latin we can trace in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talis</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tantus</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tunc</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tam</span></em>, and even
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tamen</span></em>, an old locative in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">men</span></em>. We have thus seen
that what we call the third person singular of the
present is in reality a simple compound of a predicative
root with a demonstrative root. It is a compound like
any other, only that the second part is not predicative,
but simply demonstrative. As in pay-master we predicate
pay of master, meaning a person whose office it is
to pay, so in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadâ-ti</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">give-he</span></em>, the ancient framers of language
simply predicated giving of some third person,
and this synthetic proposition, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">give-he</span></em>, is the same as
what we now call the third person singular in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indicative mood, of the present tense, in the active

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have necessarily confined ourselves in our analysis
of language to that family of languages to which
our own tongue, and those with which we are best acquainted,
belong; but what applies to Sanskrit and the
Aryan family applies to the whole realm of human
speech. Every language, without a single exception,
that has as yet been cast into the crucible of comparative
grammar, has been found to contain these two substantial
elements, predicative and demonstrative roots.
In the Semitic family these two constituent elements
are even more palpable than in Sanskrit and Greek.
Even before the discovery of Sanskrit, and the rise of
comparative philology, Semitic scholars had successfully
traced back the whole dictionary of Hebrew and Arabic
to a small number of roots, and as every root in
these languages consists of three consonants, the Semitic
languages have sometimes been called by the name
of triliteral.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To a still higher degree the constituent elements are,
as it were, on the very surface in the Turanian family
of speech. It is one of the characteristic features of
that family, that, whatever the number of prefixes and
suffixes, the root must always stand out in full relief,
and must never be allowed to suffer by its contact with
derivative elements.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is one language, the Chinese, in which no
analysis of any kind is required for the discovery of its
component parts. It is a language in which no coalescence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of roots has taken place: every word is a root,
and every root is a word. It is, in fact, the most primitive
stage in which we can imagine human language
to have existed. It is language <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comme il faut</span></em>; it is
what we should naturally have expected all languages
to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, no doubt, numerous dialects in Asia,
Africa, America, and Polynesia, which have not yet
been dissected by the knife of the grammarian; but we
may be satisfied at least with this negative evidence,
that, as yet, no language which has passed through
the ordeal of grammatical analysis has ever disclosed
any but these two constituent elements.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem, therefore, of the origin of language,
which seemed so perplexing and mysterious to the ancient
philosophers, assumes a much simpler aspect with
us. We have learnt what language is made of; we
have found that everything in language, except the
roots, is intelligible, and can be accounted for. There
is nothing to surprise us in the combination of the
predicative and demonstrative roots which led to the
building up of all the languages with which we are
acquainted, from Chinese to English. It is not only
conceivable, as Professor Pott remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the formation
of the Sanskrit language, as it is handed down
to us, may have been preceded by a state of the greatest
simplicity and entire absence of inflections, such
as is exhibited to the present day by the Chinese and
other monosyllabic languages.”</span> It is absolutely impossible
that it should have been otherwise. After we
have seen that all languages must have started from
this Chinese or monosyllabic stage, the only portion of
the problem of the origin of language that remains to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be solved is this: How can we account for the origin
of those predicative and demonstrative roots which form
the constituent elements of all human speech, and
which have hitherto resisted all attempts at further
analysis? This problem will form the subject of our
two next Lectures.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We finished in our last Lecture our analysis of language,
and we arrived at the result that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">predicative</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrative</span></em> roots are the sole constituent elements of
human speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now turn back in order to discover how many
possible forms of language may be produced by the free
combination of these constituent elements; and we
shall then endeavor to find out whether each of these
possible forms has its real counterpart in some or other of
the dialects of mankind. We are attempting in fact to
carry out a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morphological classification</span></em> of speech, which
is based entirely on the form or manner in which roots
are put together, and therefore quite independent of the
genealogical classification which, according to its very
nature, is based on the formations of language handed
down ready made from generation to generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before, however, we enter on this, the principal subject
of our present Lecture, we have still to examine,
as briefly as possible, a second family of speech, which,
like the Aryan, is established on the strictest principles
of genealogical classification, namely, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Semitic</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Semitic family is divided into three branches,
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aramaic</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hebraic</span></em>, and the

The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aramaic</span></em> occupies the north, including Syria,
Mesopotamia, and part of the ancient kingdoms of Babylonia
and Assyria. It is known to us chiefly in two
dialects, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Chaldee</span></em>. The former name is
given to the language which has been preserved to us
in a translation of the Bible (the Peshito<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>) ascribed to
the second century, and in the rich Christian literature
dating from the fourth. It is still spoken, though in a
very corrupt form, by the Nestorians of Kurdistan, near
the lakes of Van and Urmia, and by some Christian
tribes in Mesopotamia; and an attempt has been made
by the American missionaries,<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> stationed at Urmia, to
restore this dialect to some grammatical correctness by
publishing translations and a grammar of what they call
the Neo-Syriac language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Chaldee</span></em> has been given to the language
adopted by the Jews during the Babylonian captivity.
Though the Jews always retained a knowledge of their
sacred language, they soon began to adopt the dialect
of their conquerors, not for conversation only, but also
for literary composition.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> The book of Ezra contains
fragments in Chaldee, contemporaneous with the cuneiform

of the Aramaic, or the language of Babylonia, as transplanted
to Palestine. This Aramaic was the dialect
spoken by Christ and his disciples. The few authentic
words preserved in the New Testament as spoken
by our Lord in His own language, such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Talitha
kumi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephphatha</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Abba</span></em>, are not in Hebrew, but in the
Chaldee, or Aramaic, as then spoken by the
Jews.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the destruction of Jerusalem the literature of
the Jews continued to be written in the same dialect.
The Talmud<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> of Jerusalem of the fourth, and that
of Babylon of the fifth, century exhibit the Aramean,
as spoken by the educated Jews settled in these two
localities, though greatly depraved and spoiled by an admixture
of strange elements. This language remained
the literary idiom of the Jews to the tenth century.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Masora</span></span>,<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> and the traditional commentary of the Old
Testament, was written in it about that time. Soon
after the Jews adopted Arabic as their literary language,
and retained it to the thirteenth century. They
then returned to a kind of modernized Hebrew, which
they still continue to employ for learned discussions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is curious that the Aramaic branch of the Semitic
family, though originally the language of the great
kingdoms of Babylon and Nineveh, should have been
preserved to us only in the literature of the Jews, and
of the Christians of Syria. There must have been a
Babylonian literature, for the wisdom of the Chaldeans
had acquired a reputation which could hardly have
been sustained without a literature. Abraham must
have spoken Aramaic before he emigrated to Canaan.
Laban spoke the same dialect, and the name which he
gave to the heap of stones that was to be a witness
between him and Jacob, (Jegar-sahadutha) is Syriac,
whereas Galeed, the name by which Jacob called it,
is Hebrew.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> If we are ever to recover a knowledge
of that ancient Babylonian literature, it must
be from the cuneiform inscriptions lately brought home
from Babylon and Nineveh. They are clearly written
in a Semitic language. About this there can
be no longer any doubt. And though the progress
in deciphering them has been slow, and slower than
was at one time expected, yet there is no reason to
despair. In a letter, dated April, 1853, Sir Henry
Rawlinson wrote:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the clay tablets which we have found at Nineveh,
and which now are to be counted by thousands,
there are explanatory treatises on almost every subject
under the sun: the art of writing, grammars, and dictionaries,
notation, weights and measures, divisions of
time, chronology, astronomy, geography, history, mythology,
geology, botany, &amp;c. In fact we have now at
our disposal a perfect cyclopædia of Assyrian science.”</span>
Considering what has been achieved in deciphering one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
class of cuneiform inscriptions, the Persian, there is no
reason to doubt that the whole of that cyclopædia will
some day be read with the same ease with which we
read the mountain records of Darius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, however, another miserable remnant of
what was once the literature of the Chaldeans or
Babylonians, namely, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Adam,”</span> and similar
works preserved by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mendaïtes</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nasoreans</span></span>, a curious
sect settled near Bassora. Though the composition
of these works is as late as the tenth century after
Christ, it has been supposed that under a modern crust
of wild and senseless hallucinations, they contain some
grains of genuine ancient Babylonian thought. These
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mendaïtes</span></span> have in
fact been identified with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nabateans</span></span>,
who are mentioned as late as the tenth century<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>
of our era, as a race purely pagan, and distinct from
Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans. In Arabic the
name Nabatean<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> is used for Babylonians,—nay,
all the people of Aramaic origin, settled in the earliest
times between the Euphrates and Tigris are referred
to by that name.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> It is supposed that the Nabateans,
who are mentioned about the beginning of the Christian
era as a race distinguished for their astronomical
and general scientific knowledge, were the ancestors
of the mediæval Nabateans, and the descendants of
the ancient Babylonians and Chaldeans. You may
have lately seen in some literary journals an account
of a work called <span class="tei tei-q">“The Nabatean Agriculture.”</span> It
exists only in an Arabic translation by Ibn-Wahshiyyah,
the Chaldean,<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>
who lived about 900 years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after Christ, but the original, which was written by
Kuthami in Aramean, has lately been referred to
the beginning of the thirteenth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span> The
evidence is not yet fully before us, but from what is
known it seems more likely that this work was the
compilation of a Nabatean, who lived about the fourth
century after Christ;<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> and though it contains ancient
traditions, which may go back to the days of the great
Babylonian monarchs, these traditions can hardly be
taken as a fair representation of the ancient civilization
of the Aramean race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second branch of the Semitic family is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hebraic</span></em>,
chiefly represented by the ancient language of
Palestine, where Hebrew was spoken and written from
the days of Moses to the times of Nehemiah and the
Maccabees, though of course with considerable modifications,
and with a strong admixture of Aramean
forms, particularly since the Babylonian captivity, and
the rise of a powerful civilization in the neighboring
country of Syria. The ancient language of Phœnicia,
to judge from inscriptions, was most closely allied to
Hebrew, and the language of the Carthaginians too
must be referred to the same branch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hebrew was first encroached upon by Aramaic dialects,
through the political ascendency of Babylon, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still more of Syria; and was at last swept away by
Arabic, which, since the conquest of Palestine and
Syria in the year 636, has monopolized nearly the
whole area formerly occupied by the two older branches
of the Semitic stock, the Aramaic and Hebrew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This third, or Arabic, branch sprang from the Arabian
peninsula, where it is still spoken by a compact
mass of aboriginal inhabitants. Its most ancient documents
are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Himyaritic</span></em> inscriptions. In very early
times this Arabic branch was transplanted to Africa,
where, south of Egypt and Nubia, on the coast opposite
Yemen, an ancient Semitic dialect has maintained
itself to the present day. This is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ethiopic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Abyssinian</span></em>,
or, as it is called by the people themselves, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gees</span></em> language. Though no longer spoken in its purity
by the people of Habesh, it is still preserved in their
sacred writings, translations of the Bible, and similar
works, which date from the third and fourth centuries.
The modern language of Abyssinia is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Amharic</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest literary documents of Arabic go back
beyond Mohammed. They are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Moallakat</span></em>, literally,
suspended poems, because they are said to have
been thus publicly exhibited at Mecca. They are old
popular poems, descriptive of desert life. With Mohammed
Arabic became the language of a victorious
religion, and established its sway over Asia, Africa,
and Europe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These three branches, the Aramaic, the Hebraic,
and Arabic, are so closely related to each other, that
it was impossible not to recognize their common origin.
Every root in these languages, as far back as we know
them, must consist of three consonants, and numerous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words are derived from these roots by a simple change
of vowels, leaving the consonantal skeleton as much
as possible intact. It is impossible to mistake a Semitic
language; and what is most important—it is
impossible to imagine an Aryan language derived
from a Semitic, or a Semitic from an Aryan language.
The grammatical framework is totally distinct in these
two families of speech. This does not exclude, however,
the possibility that both are diverging streams of
the same source; and the comparisons that have been
instituted between the Semitic roots, reduced to their
simplest form, and the roots of the Aryan languages,
have made it more than probable that the material elements
with which they both started were originally the
same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other languages which are supposed to belong to the
Semitic family are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Berber</span></em> dialects of Northern
Africa, spoken on the coast from Egypt to the Atlantic
Ocean before the invasion of the Arabs, and now
pushed back towards the interior. Some other African
languages, too, such as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Haussa</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Galla</span></em>, have
been classed as Semitic; and the language of Egypt,
from the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions to the Coptic,
which ceased to be spoken after the seventeenth century,
has equally been referred to this class. The
Semitic character of these dialects, however, is much
less clearly defined, and the exact degree of relationship
in which they stand to the Semitic languages,
properly so-called, has still to be determined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Strictly speaking the Aryan and Semitic are the
only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">families</span></em> of speech which fully deserve that title.
They both presuppose the existence of a finished system
of grammar, previous to the first divergence of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their dialects. Their history is from the beginning a
history of decay rather than of growth, and hence the
unmistakable family-likeness which pervades every one
even of their latest descendants. The language of the
Sepoy and that of the English soldier are, strictly
speaking, one and the same language. They are both
built up of materials which were definitely shaped before
the Teutonic and Indic branches separated. No
new root has been added to either since their first separation;
and the grammatical forms which are of more
modern growth in English or Hindustání, are, if closely
examined, new combinations only of elements which
existed from the beginning in all the Aryan dialects.
In the termination of the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he is</span></em>, and in the inaudible
termination of the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">il est</span></em>, we recognize
the result of an act performed before the first separation
of the Aryan family, the combination of the predicative
root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></em> with the demonstrative root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></em>; an act
performed once for all, and continuing to be felt to the
present day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the custom of Nebuchadnezzar to have his
name stamped on every brick that was used during
his reign in erecting his colossal palaces. Those palaces
fell to ruins, but from the ruins the ancient materials
were carried away for building new cities; and on
examining the bricks in the walls of the modern city
of Baghdad on the borders of the Tigris, Sir Henry
Rawlinson discovered on each the clear traces of that
royal signature. It is the same if we examine the
structure of modern languages. They too were built
up with the materials taken from the ruins of the ancient
languages, and every word, if properly examined,
displays the visible stamp impressed upon it from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first by the founders of the Aryan and the Semitic
empires of speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relationship of languages, however, is not always
so close. Languages may diverge before their
grammatical system has become fixed and hardened;
and in that case they cannot be expected to show the
same marked features of a common descent as, for
instance, the Neo-Latin dialects, French, Italian, and
Spanish. They may have much in common, but they
will likewise display an after-growth in words and
grammatical forms peculiar to each dialect. With regard
to words we see that even languages so intimately
related to each other as the six Romance dialects,
diverged in some of the commonest expressions. Instead
of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frater</span></em>, the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frère</span></em>, we find in
Spanish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hermano</span></em>. There was a very good reason for
this change. The Latin word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frater</span></em>, changed into
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fray</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frayle</span></em>, had been applied to express a brother
or a friar. It was felt inconvenient that the same word
should express two ideas which it was sometimes necessary
to distinguish, and therefore, by a kind of natural
elimination, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frater</span></em> was given up as the name of brother
in Spanish, and replaced from the dialectical stores of
Latin, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">germanus</span></em>. In the same manner the Latin
word for shepherd, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pastor</span></em>, was so constantly applied to
the shepherd of the people or the clergyman, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">le pasteur</span></em>,
that a new word was wanted for the real shepherd. Thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">berbicarius</span></em> from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">berbex</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vervex</span></em>, a wether, was
used instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pastor</span></em>, and changed into the French
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">berger</span></em>. Instead of the Spanish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enfermo</span></em>, ill, we find in
French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malade</span></em>, in Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malato</span></em>. Languages so intimately
related as Greek and Latin have fixed on different
expressions for son, daughter, brother, woman,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man, sky, earth, moon, hand, mouth, tree, bird,
&amp;c.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
That is to say, out of a large number of synonymes
which were supplied by the numerous dialects of the
Aryan family, the Greeks perpetuated one, the Romans
another. It is clear that when the working of
this principle of natural selection is allowed to extend
more widely, languages, though proceeding from the
same source, may in time acquire a totally different
nomenclature for the commonest objects. The number
of real synonymes is frequently exaggerated, and
if we are told that in Icelandic there are 120 names for
island, or in Arabic 500 names for lion,<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> and 1,000
names for sword,<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> many of these are no doubt purely
poetical. But even where there are in a language only
four or five names for the same objects, it is clear that
four languages might be derived from it, each in appearance
quite distinct from the rest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same applies to grammar. When the Romance
languages, for instance, formed their new future by
placing the auxiliary verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habere</span></em>, to have, after the
infinitive, it was quite open to any one of them to fix
upon some other expedient for expressing the future.
The French might have chosen <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je vais dire</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je dirvais</span></em>
(I wade to say) instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je dirai</span></em>, and in this
case the future in French would have been totally distinct
from the future in Italian. If such changes are
possible in literary languages of such long standing as
French and Italian, we must be prepared for a great
deal more in languages which, as I said, diverged before
any definite settlement had taken place either in their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grammar or their dictionary. If we were to expect in
them the definite criteria of a genealogical relationship
which unites the members of the Aryan and Semitic
families of speech, we should necessarily be disappointed.
Such criteria could not possibly exist in these
languages. But there are criteria for determining even
these more distant degrees of relationship in the vast
realm of speech; and they are sufficient at least to arrest
the hasty conclusions of those who would deny the
possibility of a common origin of any languages more
removed from each other than French and Italian,
Sanskrit and Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. You will
see this more clearly after we have examined the principles
of what I call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morphological classification</span></em> of
human speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As all languages, so far as we can judge at present,
can be reduced in the end to roots, predicative and
demonstrative, it is clear that, according to the manner
in which roots are put together, we may expect
to find three kinds of languages, or three stages in the
gradual formation of speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Roots may be used as words, each root preserving
its full independence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Two roots may be joined together to form words,
and in these compounds one root may lose its independence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Two roots may be joined together to form words,
and in these compounds both roots may lose their independence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What applies to two roots, applies to three or four
or more. The principle is the same, though it would
lead to a more varied subdivision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first stage, in which each root preserves its independence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and in which there is no formal distinction
between a root and a word, I call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Radical Stage</span></em>.
This stage is best represented by ancient Chinese.
Languages belonging to this first or Radical Stage,
have sometimes been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Monosyllabic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Isolating</span></em>.
The second stage, in which two or more roots coalesce
to form a word, the one retaining its radical independence,
the other sinking down to a mere termination,
I call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Terminational Stage</span></em>. This stage is best
represented by the Turanian family of speech, and the
languages belonging to it have generally been called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agglutinative</span></em>, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gluten</span></em>, glue. The third stage, in
which roots coalesce so that neither the one nor the
other retains its substantive independence, I call the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inflectional Stage</span></em>. This stage is best represented by
the Aryan and Semitic families, and the languages
belonging to it have sometimes been distinguished by
the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amalgamating</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first stage excludes phonetic corruption altogether.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second stage excludes phonetic corruption in
the principal root, but allows it in the secondary or
determinative elements.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third stage allows phonetic corruption both in
the principal root and in the terminations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few instances will make this classification clearer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first stage, which is represented by Chinese,
every word is a root, and has its own substantial meaning.
Thus, where we say in Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">baculo</span></em>, with a stick,
we say in Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ ćáng</span></em>.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> Here <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ</span></em> might be taken
for a mere preposition, like the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em>. But in
Chinese this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ</span></em> is a root; it is the same word which,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if used as a verb, would mean <span class="tei tei-q">“to employ.”</span> Therefore
in Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ ćáng</span></em> means literally <span class="tei tei-q">“employ stick.”</span>
Or again, where we say in English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at home</span></em>, or in Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">domi</span></em>, the Chinese say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ŭŏ-li, ŭŏ</span></em> meaning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">house</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">li</span></em> originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inside</span></em>.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> The name for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">day</span></em> in Chinese
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģi-tse</span></em>, which means originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">son of the
sun</span></em>.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is in Chinese, as we saw before, no formal
distinction between a noun, a verb, an adjective, an
adverb, a preposition. The same root, according to
its position in a sentence, may be employed to convey
the meaning of great, greatness, greatly, and to be
great. Everything in fact depends in Chinese on the
proper collocation of words in a sentence. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngò
tà ni</span></em> means <span class="tei tei-q">“I beat thee;”</span> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ni tà ngò</span></em> would mean
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou beatest me.”</span> Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngŏ ģin</span></em> means <span class="tei tei-q">“a bad
man;”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin ngŏ</span></em> would mean <span class="tei tei-q">“the man is bad.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As long as every word, or part of a word, is felt to
express its own radical meaning, a language belongs
to the first or radical stage. As soon as such words
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tse</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģi-tse</span></em>, day, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">li</span></em>
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ŭŏ-li</span></em>, at home, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳ-ćáng</span></em>,
with the stick, lose their etymological meaning and
become mere signs of derivation or of case, language
enters into the second or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Terminational</span></em> stage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By far the largest number of languages belong to
this stage. The whole of what is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Turanian</span></em>
family of speech consists of Terminational or Agglutinative
languages, and this Turanian family comprises
in reality all languages spoken in Asia and Europe,
and not included under the Aryan and Semitic families,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the exception of Chinese and its cognate
dialects. In the great continent of the Old World
the Semitic and Aryan languages occupy only what
may be called the four western peninsulas, namely,
India with Persia, Arabia, Asia Minor, and Europe;
and we have reason to suppose that even these countries
were held by Turanian tribes previous to the
arrival of the Aryan and Semitic nations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This Turanian family is of great importance in the
science of languages. Some scholars would deny it
the name of a family; and if family is only applicable
to dialects so closely connected among themselves as
the Aryan or Semitic, it would no doubt be preferable
to speak of the Turanian as a class or group, and not
as a family of languages. But this concession must
not be understood as an admission that the members
of this class start from different sources, and that
they are held together, not by genealogical affinity,
but by morphological similarity only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These languages share elements in common which
they must have borrowed from the same source, and
their formal coincidences, though of a different character
from those of the Aryan and Semitic families,
are such that it would be impossible to ascribe them
to mere accident.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The name Turanian is used in opposition to Aryan,
and is applied to the nomadic races of Asia as opposed
to the agricultural or Aryan races.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Turanian family or class consists of two great
divisions, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Northern</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Southern</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Northern is sometimes called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ural-Altaic</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ugro-Tataric</span></em>, and it is divided into five sections, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tungusic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mongolic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Turkic</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Finnic</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Samoyedic</span></em>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Southern, which occupies the south of Asia, is
divided into four classes, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tamulic</span></em>, or the languages
of the Dekhan; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhotîya</span></em>, or the dialects of Tibet
and Bhotan; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Taïc</span></em>, or the dialects of Siam,
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Malaic</span></em>, or the Malay and Polynesian dialects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No doubt if we expected to find in this immense
number of languages the same family likeness which
holds the Semitic or Aryan languages together, we
should be disappointed. But the very absence of that
family likeness constitutes one of the distinguishing
features of the Turanian dialects. They are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nomad</span></em>
languages, as contrasted with the Aryan, and Semitic
languages.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> In the latter most words and grammatical
forms were thrown out but once by the creative
power of one generation, and they were not lightly
parted with, even though their original distinctness
had been blurred by phonetic corruption. To hand
down a language in this manner is possible only among
people whose history runs on in one main stream; and
where religion, law, and poetry supply well-defined borders
which hem in on every side the current of language.
Among the Turanian nomads no such nucleus
of a political, social, or literary character has ever been
formed. Empires were no sooner founded than they
were scattered again like the sand-clouds of the desert;
no laws, no songs, no stories outlived the age of their
authors. How quickly language can change, if thus
left to itself without any literary standard, we saw in
a former Lecture, when treating of the growth of dialects.
The most necessary substantives, such as father,
mother, daughter, son, have frequently been lost and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
replaced by synonymes in the different dialects of Turanian
speech, and the grammatical terminations have
been treated with the same freedom. Nevertheless,
some of the Turanian numerals and pronouns, and
many Turanian roots, point to a single original source;
and the common words and common roots, which have
been discovered in the most distant branches of the
Turanian stock, warrant the admission of a real, though
very distant, genealogical relationship of all Turanian
speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most characteristic feature of the Turanian languages
is what has been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Agglutination</span></em>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“gluing
together.”</span><a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> This means not only that, in their
grammar, pronouns are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">glued</span></em> to the verbs in order to
form the conjugation, or prepositions to substantives in
order to form declension. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> would not be a distinguishing
characteristic of the Turanian or nomad languages;
for in Hebrew as well as in Sanskrit, conjugation
and declension were originally formed on the same
principle. What distinguishes the Turanian languages
is, that in them the conjugation and declension can still
be taken to pieces; and although the terminations have
by no means always retained their significative power
as independent words, they are felt as modificatory syllables,
and as distinct from the roots to which they are
appended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Aryan languages the modifications of words,
comprised under declension and conjugation, were likewise
originally expressed by agglutination. But the
component parts began soon to coalesce, so as to form
one integral word, liable in its turn to phonetic corruption
to such an extent that it became impossible after a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time to decide which was the root and which the modificatory
element. The difference between an Aryan and
a Turanian language is somewhat the same as between
good and bad mosaic. The Aryan words seem made of
one piece, the Turanian words clearly show the sutures
and fissures where the small stones are cemented
together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a very good reason why the Turanian
languages should have remained in this second or
agglutinative stage. It was felt essential that the radical
portion of each word should stand out in distinct relief,
and never be obscured or absorbed, as happens in the
third or inflectional stage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âge</span></em>, for instance, has lost its whole material
body, and is nothing but termination. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Age</span></em> in
old French was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eage</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">edage</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Edage</span></em> is a
corruption of the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œtaticum</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œtaticum</span></em> is a derivative of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œtas</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œtas</span></em> an abbreviation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvitas</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvitas</span></em> is derived
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvum</span></em>, and in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvum</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œ</span></em> only is the radical
or predicative element, the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ây</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ây-us</span></em>, life,
which contains the germ from which these various
words derive their life and meaning. From <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvum</span></em>
the Romans derived <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œviternus</span></em>, contracted into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œternus</span></em>,
so that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">age</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternity</span></em> flow from the same
source. What trace of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œ</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvum</span></em>, or even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œvitas</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">œtas</span></em>, remains in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âge</span></em>? Turanian languages cannot
afford such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âge</span></em> in their dictionaries. It
is an indispensable requirement in a nomadic language
that it should be intelligible to many, though
their intercourse be but scanty. It requires tradition,
society, and literature, to maintain words and
forms which can no longer be analyzed at once. Such
words would seldom spring up in nomadic languages,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or if they did, they would die away with each generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Aryan verb contains many forms in which the
personal pronoun is no longer felt distinctly. And yet
tradition, custom, and law preserve the life of these
veterans, and make us feel unwilling to part with them.
But in the ever-shifting state of a nomadic society no
debased coin can be tolerated in language, no obscure
legend accepted on trust. The metal must be pure,
and the legend distinct; that the one may be weighed,
and the other, if not deciphered, at least recognized as
a well-known guarantee. Hence the small proportion
of irregular forms in all agglutinative languages.<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Turanian might tolerate the Sanskrit,
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">as-mi,  a-si,      as-ti,   's-mas,   's-tha,    's-anti,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">I am,   thou art,  he is,   we are,   you are,   they are;</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
or even the Latin,
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">'s-um,  e-s,       es-t,   'su-mus,   es-tis,    'sunt.</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these instances, with a few exceptions, root and
affix are as distinguishable as, for instance, in Turkish:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">bakar-im,     bakar-sin,         bakar,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">I regard,     thou regardest,    he regards.</div>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">bakar-iz,     bakar-siniz,       bakar-lar</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">we regard,    you regard,        they regard.</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a conjugation like the Hindustání, which is a modern
Aryan dialect,
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">hun, hai, hai, hain, ho, hain,</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
would not be compatible with the genius of the Turanian
languages, because it would not answer the
requirements of a nomadic life. Turanian dialects
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exhibit either no terminational distinctions at all, as
in Mandshu, which is a Tungusic dialect; or a complete
and intelligible system of affixes, as in the spoken
dialect of Nyertchinsk, equally of Tungusic descent.
But a state of conjugation in which, through phonetic
corruption, the suffix of the first person singular and
plural, and of the third person plural are the same,
where there is no distinction between the second and
third persons singular, and between the first and third
persons plural, would necessarily lead, in a Turanian
dialect, to the adoption of new and more expressive
forms. New pronouns would have to be used to mark
the persons, or some other expedient be resorted to for
the same purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And this will make it still more clear why the
Turanian languages, or in fact all languages in this
second or agglutinative stage, though protected against
phonetic corruption more than the Aryan and Semitic
languages, are so much exposed to the changes produced
by dialectical regeneration. A Turanian retains,
as it were, the consciousness of his language and
grammar. The idea, for instance, which he connects
with a plural is that of a noun followed by a syllable
indicative of plurality; a passive with him is a verb
followed by a syllable expressive of suffering, or eating,
or going.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> Now these determinative ideas may be
expressed in various ways, and though in one and the
same clan, and during one period of time, a certain
number of terminations would become stationary, and
be assigned to the expression of certain grammatical
categories, such as the plural, the passive, the genitive,
different hordes, as they separated, would still feel
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
themselves at liberty to repeat the process of grammatical
composition, and defy the comparative grammarian
to prove the identity of the terminations, even
in dialects so closely allied as Finnish and Hungarian,
or Tamil and Telugu.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must not be supposed, however, that Turanian or
agglutinative languages are forever passing through
this process of grammatical regeneration. Where nomadic
tribes approach to a political organization, their
language, though Turanian, may approach to the system
of political or traditional languages, such as Sanskrit
or Hebrew. This is indeed the case with the most
advanced members of the Turanian family, the Hungarian,
the Finnish, the Tamil, Telugu, &amp;c. Many
of their grammatical terminations have suffered by
phonetic corruption, but they have not been replaced
by new and more expressive words. The termination
of the plural is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lu</span></em> in Telugu, and this is probably a
mere corruption of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gaḷ.</span></em>, the termination of the plural
in Tamil. The only characteristic Turanian feature
which always remains is this: the root is never obscured.
Besides this, the determining or modifying
syllables are generally placed at the end, and the
vowels do not become so absolutely fixed for each
syllable as in Sanskrit or Hebrew. On the contrary,
there is what is called the Law of Harmony, according
to which the vowels of each word may be changed and
modulated so as to harmonize with the key-note struck
by its chief vowel. The vowels in Turkish, for instance,
are divided into two classes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sharp</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">flat</span></em>. If
a verb contains a sharp vowel in its radical portion,
the vowels of the terminations are all sharp, while
the same terminations, if following a root with a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flat vowel, modulate their own vowels into the flat
key. Thus we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-mek</span></em>, to love, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bak-mak</span></em>,
to regard, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mek</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mak</span></em> being the termination of the
infinitive. Thus we say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ev-ler</span></em>, the houses, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at-lar</span></em>,
the horses, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ler</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lar</span></em> being the termination of the plural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No Aryan or Semitic language has preserved a similar
freedom in the harmonic arrangement of its vowels,
while traces of it have been found among the most distant
members of the Turanian family, as in Hungarian,
Mongolian, Turkish, the Yakut, spoken in the
north of Siberia, and in dialects spoken on the eastern
frontiers of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For completeness' sake I add a short account of the
Turanian family, chiefly taken from my Survey of
Languages, published 1855:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tungusic Class.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tungusic</span></em> branch extends from China northward
to Siberia and westward to 113°, where the
river Tunguska partly marks its frontier. The Tungusic
tribes in Siberia are under Russian sway.
Other Tungusic tribes belong to the Chinese empire,
and are known by the name of Mandshu, a name
taken after they had conquered China in 1644, and
founded the present imperial dynasty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mongolic Class.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The original seats of the people who speak Mongolic
dialects lie near the Lake Baikal and in the
eastern parts of Siberia, where we find them as early
as the ninth century after Christ. They were divided
into three classes, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mongols</span></em> proper, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Buriäts</span></em>, and
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ölöts</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kalmüks</span></em>. Chingis-khán (1227) united
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them into a nation and founded the Mongolian empire,
which included, however, not only Mongolic, but
Tungusic and Turkic, commonly called Tataric, tribes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The name of Tatar soon became the terror of Asia
and Europe, and it was applied promiscuously to all
the nomadic warriors whom Asia then poured forth
over Europe. Originally Tatar was a name of the
Mongolic races, but through their political ascendency
in Asia after Chingis-khán, it became usual to call
all the tribes which were under Mongolian sway by
the name of Tatar. In linguistic works Tataric is
now used in two several senses. Following the example
of writers of the Middle Ages, Tataric, like
Scythian in Greek, has been fixed upon as the general
term comprising <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> languages spoken by the nomadic
tribes of Asia. Hence it is used sometimes in the
same sense in which we use Turanian. Secondly,
Tataric has become the name of that class of Turanian
languages of which the Turkish is the most
prominent member. While the Mongolic class—that
which in fact has the greatest claims to the name of
Tataric—is never so called, it has become an almost
universal custom to apply this name to the third or
Turkic branch of the Ural-Altaic division; and the
races belonging to this branch have in many instances
themselves adopted the name. These Turkish, or as
they are more commonly called, Tataric races, were
settled on the northern side of the Caspian Sea, and
on the Black Sea, and were known as Komanes,
Pechenegs, and Bulgars, when conquered by the
Mongolic army of the son of Chingis-khán, who
founded the Kapchakian empire, extending from the
Dniestr to the Yemba and the Kirgisian steppes.
Russia for two centuries was under the sway of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Kháns, known as the Khans of the Golden Horde.
This empire was dissolved towards the end of the
fifteenth century, and several smaller kingdoms rose
out of its ruins. Among these Krim, Kasan, and
Astrachan, were the most important. The princes
of these kingdoms still gloried in their descent from
Chingis-khán, and had hence a right to the name of
Mongols or Tatars. But their armies and subjects
also, who were of Turkish blood, received the name
of their princes; and their languages continued to be
called Tataric, even after the tribes by whom they
were spoken had been brought under the Russian
sceptre, and were no longer governed by khans of
Mongolic or Tataric origin. It would perhaps be desirable
to use Turkic instead of Tataric, when speaking
of the third branch of the northern division of the
Turanian family, did not a change of terminology
generally produce as much confusion as it remedies.
The recollection of their non-Tataric, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> non-Mongolic
origin, remains, it appears, among the so-called
Tatars of Kasan and Astrachan. If asked whether
they are Tatars, they reply no; and they call their
language Turki or Turuk, but not Tatari. Nay, they
consider Tatar as a term of abuse, synonymous with
robber, evidently from a recollection that their ancestors
had once been conquered and enslaved by Mongolic,
that is, Tataric, tribes. All this rests on the
authority of Klaproth, who during his stay in Russia
had great opportunities of studying the languages spoken
on the frontiers of this half-Asiatic empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conquests of the Mongols or the descendants of
Chingis-khán were not confined, however, to these
Turkish tribes. They conquered China in the east,
where they founded the Mongolic dynasty of Yuan,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and in the west, after subduing the khalifs of Bagdad,
and the Sultans of Iconium, they conquered Moscow,
and devastated the greater part of Russia. In 1240
they invaded Poland, in 1241 Silesia. Here they
recoiled before the united armies of Germany, Poland,
and Silesia. They retired into Moravia, and having
exhausted that country, occupied Hungary. At that
time they had to choose a new khan, which could
only be done at Karakorum, the old capital of their
empire. Thither they withdrew to elect an emperor
to govern an empire which then extended from China
to Poland, from India to Siberia. But a realm of such
vast proportions could not be long held together, and
towards the end of the thirteenth century it broke up
into several independent states, all under Mongolian
princes, but no longer under one khan of khans. Thus
new independent Mongolic empires arose in China,
Turkestan, Siberia, Southern Russia, and Persia. In
1360, the Mongolian dynasty was driven out of China;
in the fifteenth century they lost their hold on Russia.
In Central Asia they rallied once more under Timur
(1369), whose sway was again acknowledged from
Karakorum to Persia and Anatolia. But in 1468, this
empire also fell by its own weight, and for want of
powerful rulers like Chingis-khán or Timur. In Jagatai
alone, the country extending from the Aral Lake
to the Hindu-kush, between the rivers Oxus and
Yaxartes (Jihon and Sihon), and once governed by
Jagatai, the son of Chingis-khán—the Mongolian dynasty
maintained itself, and thence it was that Baber,
a descendant of Timur, conquered India, and founded
there a Mongolian dynasty, surviving up to our
own times in the Great Moguls of Delhi. Most
Mongolic tribes are now under the sway of the nations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whom they once had conquered, the Tungusic
sovereigns of China, the Russian czars, and the Turkish
sultans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mongolic language, although spoken (but not
continuously) from China as far as the Volga, has
given rise to but few dialects. Next to Tungusic,
the Mongolic is the poorest language of the Turanian
family, and the scantiness of grammatical terminations
accounts for the fact that, as a language, it has remained
very much unchanged. There is, however, a
distinction between the language as spoken by the
Eastern, Western, and Northern tribes, and incipient
traces of grammatical life have lately been discovered
by Castrén, the great Swedish traveller and Turanian
philologist, in the spoken dialect of the Buriäts. In
it the persons of the verb are distinguished by affixes,
while, according to the rules of Mongolic grammar,
no other dialect distinguishes in the verb between am<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">o</span></em>,
am<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></em>, am<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mongols who live in Europe have fixed their
tents on each side of the Volga and along the coast of
the Caspian Sea near Astrachan. Another colony is
found south-east of Sembirsk. They belong to the
Western branch, and are Ölöts or Kalmüks, who left
their seats on the Koko-nur, and entered Europe in
1662. They proceeded from the clans Dürbet and
Torgod, but most of the Torgods returned again in
1770, and their descendants are now scattered over
the Kirgisian steppes.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Turkic Class</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Much more important are the languages belonging
to the third branch of the Turanian family, most
prominent among which is the Turkish or Osmanli of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Constantinople. The number of the Turkish inhabitants
of European Turkey is indeed small. It is generally
stated at 2,000,000; but Shafarik estimates the
number of genuine Turks at not more than 700,000,
who rule over fifteen millions of people. The different
Turkic dialects of which the Osmanli is one, occupy
one of the largest linguistic areas, extending from the
Lena and the Polar Sea, down to the Adriatic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most ancient name by which the Turkic tribes
of Central Asia were known to the Chinese was
Hiung-nu. These Hiung-nu founded an empire (206
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b. c.</span></span>) comprising a large portion of Asia, west of
China. Engaged in frequent wars with the Chinese,
they were defeated at last in the middle of the first
century after Christ. Thereupon they divided into a
northern and southern empire; and, after the southern
Hiung-nu had become subjects of China, they attacked
the northern Hiung-nu, together with the Chinese,
and, driving them out of their seats between the rivers
Amur and Selenga, and the Altai mountains, westward,
they are supposed to have given the first impulse
to the inroads of the barbarians into Europe. In the
beginning of the third century, the Mongolic and Tungusic
tribes, who had filled the seats of the northern
Hiung-nu, had grown so powerful as to attack the
southern Hiung-nu and drive them from their territories.
This occasioned a second migration of Asiatic
tribes towards the west.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another name by which the Chinese designate these
Hiung-nu or Turkish tribes is Tu-kiu. This Tu-kiu
is supposed to be identical with Turk, and, although
the tribe to which this name was given was originally
but small, it began to spread in the sixth century from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Altai to the Caspian, and it was probably to them
that in 569 the Emperor Justinian sent an ambassador
in the person of Semarchos. The empire of the Tu-kiu
was destroyed in the eighth century, by the 'Hui-'he
(Chinese Kao-che). This tribe, equally of Turkish
origin, maintained itself for about a century, and was
then conquered by the Chinese and driven back from
the northern borders of China. Part of the 'Hui-'he
occupied Tangut, and, after a second defeat by the
Mongolians in 1257, the remnant proceeded still further
west, and joined the Uigurs, whose tents were
pitched near the towns of Turfan, 'Kashgar, 'Hamil,
and Aksu.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These facts, gleaned chiefly from Chinese historians,
show from the very earliest times the westward tendency
of the Turkish nations. In 568 Turkish tribes
occupied the country between the Volga and the sea
of Azov, and numerous reinforcements have since
strengthened their position in those parts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The northern part of Persia, west of the Caspian
Sea, Armenia, the south of Georgia, Shirwan, and
Dagestan, harbor a Turkic population, known by the
general name of Turkman or Kisil-bash (Red-caps).
They are nomadic robbers, and their arrival in these
countries dates from the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
East of the Caspian Sea the Turkman tribes are under
command of the Usbek-Khans of Khiva, Fergana,
and Bukhára. They call themselves, however, not
subjects but guests of these Khans. Still more to the
east the Turkmans are under Chinese sovereignty, and
in the south-west they reach as far as Khorasan and
other provinces of Persia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Usbeks, descendants of the 'Huy-'he and Uigurs,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and originally settled in the neighborhood of the towns
of 'Hoten, Kashgar, Turfan, and 'Hamil, crossed the
Yaxartes in the sixteenth century, and after several
successful campaigns gained possession of Balkh, Kharism
(Khiva), Bukhára, and Ferganah. In the latter
country and in Balkh they have become agricultural;
but generally their life is nomadic, and too warlike to
be called pastoral.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another Turkish tribe are the Nogái, west of the
Caspian, and also north of the Black Sea. To the
beginning of the seventeenth century they lived north-east
of the Caspian, and the steppes on the left of the
Irtish bore their name. Pressed by the Kalmüks, a
Mongolic tribe, the Nogáis advanced westward as far
as Astrachan. Peter I. transferred them thence to the
north of the Caucasian mountains, where they still
graze their flocks on the shores of the Kuban and
the Kuma. One horde, that of Kundur, remained on
the Volga, subject to the Kalmüks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another tribe of Turkish origin in the Caucasus are
the Bazianes. They now live near the sources of the
Kuban, but before the fifteenth century within the
town Majari, on the Kuma.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A third Turkish tribe in the Caucasus are the
Kumüks on the rivers Sunja, Aksai, and Koisu: now
subjects of Russia, though under native princes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The southern portion of the Altaic mountains has
long been inhabited by the Bashkirs, a race considerably
mixed with Mongolic blood, savage and ignorant,
subjects of Russia, and Mohammedans by faith. Their
land is divided into four Roads, called the Roads of
Siberia, of Kasan, of Nogai, and of Osa, a place on
the Kama. Among the Bashkirs, and in villages
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
near Ufa, is now settled a Turkish tribe, the Mescheräks
who formerly lived near the Volga.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tribes near the Lake of Aral are called Kara-Kalpak.
They are subject partly to Russia, partly to
the Khans of Khiva.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Turks of Siberia, commonly called Tatars, are
partly original settlers, who crossed the Ural, and
founded the Khanat of Sibir, partly later colonists.
Their chief towns are Tobolsk, Yeniseisk, and Tomsk.
Separate tribes are the Uran'hat on the Chulym, and
the Barabas in the steppes between the Irtish and the
Ob.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dialects of these Siberian Turks are considerably
intermingled with foreign words, taken from Mongolic,
Samoyedic, or Russian sources. Still they resemble
one another closely in all that belongs to the
original stock of the language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the north-east of Asia, on both sides of the river
Lena, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yakuts</span></em> form the most remote link in the
Turkic chain of languages. Their male population
has lately risen to 100,000, while in 1795 it amounted
only to 50,066. The Russians became first acquainted
with them in 1620. They call themselves Sakha, and
are mostly heathen, though Christianity is gaining
ground among them. According to their traditions,
their ancestors lived for a long time in company with
Mongolic tribes, and traces of this can still be discovered
in their language. Attacked by their neighbors,
they built rafts and floated down the river Lena, where
they settled in the neighborhood of what is now Yakutzk.
Their original seats seem to have been north-west
of Lake Baikal. Their language has preserved
the Turkic type more completely than any other Turco-Tataric
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dialect. Separated from the common stock at
an early time, and removed from the disturbing influences
to which the other dialects were exposed, whether
in war or in peace, the Yakutian has preserved so many
primitive features of Tataric grammar, that even now
it may be used as a key to the grammatical forms of
the Osmanli and other more cultivated Turkic dialects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Southern Siberia is the mother country of the Kirgis,
one of the most numerous tribes of Turco-Tataric
origin. The Kirgis lived originally between the Ob
and Yenisei, where Mongolic tribes settled among them.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century the Russians
became acquainted with the Eastern Kirgis, then
living along the Yenisei. In 1606 they had become
tributary to Russia, and after several wars with two
neighboring tribes, they were driven more and more
south-westward, till they left Siberia altogether at the
beginning of the eighteenth century. They now live
at Burut, in Chinese Turkestan, together with the Kirgis
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Horde,”</span> near the town of Kashgar,
north as far as the Irtish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another tribe is that of the Western Kirgis, or
Kirgis-Kasak, who are partly independent, partly tributary
to Russia and China.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of what are called the three Kirgis Hordes, from
the Caspian Sea east as far as Lake Tenghiz, the
Small Horde is fixed in the west, between the rivers
Yemba and Ural; the Great Horde in the east; while
the most powerful occupies the centre between the
Sarasu and Yemba, and is called the Middle Horde.
Since 1819, the Great Horde has been subject to Russia.
Other Kirgis tribes, though nominally subject to
Russia, are really her most dangerous enemies.

The Turks of Asia Minor and Syria came from
Khorasan and Eastern Persia, and are Turkmans, or
remnants of the Seljuks, the rulers of Persia during
the Middle Ages. The Osmanli, whom we are accustomed
to call Turks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></em>, and who form
the ruling portion of the Turkish empire, must be traced
to the same source. They are now scattered over the
whole Turkish empire in Europe, Asia, and Africa,
and their number amounts to between 11,000,000
and 12,000,000. They form the landed gentry, the
aristocracy, and bureaucracy of Turkey; and their
language, the Osmanli, is spoken by persons of rank
and education, and by all government authorities in
Syria, in Egypt, at Tunis, and at Tripoli. In the
southern provinces of Asiatic Russia, along the borders
of the Caspian, and through the whole of Turkestan,
it is the language of the people. It is heard even at
the court of Teheran, and is understood by official personages
in Persia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rise of this powerful tribe of Osman, and the
spreading of that Turkish dialect which is now emphatically
called the Turkish, are matters of historical
notoriety. We need not search for evidence in Chinese
annals, or try to discover analogies between names that
a Greek or an Arabic writer may by chance have heard
and handed down to us, and which some of these tribes
have preserved to the present day. The ancestors of
the Osman Turks are men as well known to European
historians as Charlemagne or Alfred. It was in the
year 1224 that Soliman-shah and his tribe, pressed by
Mongolians, left Khorasan and pushed westward into
Syria, Armenia, and Asia Minor. Soliman's son, Ertoghrul,
took service under Aladdin, the Seljuk Sultan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Iconium (Nicæa), and after several successful campaigns
against Greeks and Mongolians, received part
of Phrygia as his own, and there founded what was
afterwards to become the basis of the Osmanic empire.
During the last years of the thirteenth century the
Sultans of Iconium lost their power, and their former
vassals became independent sovereigns. Osman, after
taking his share of the spoil in Asia, advanced through
the Olympic passes into Bithynia and was successful
against the armies of the Emperors of Byzantium.
Osman became henceforth the national name of his
people. His son, Orkhan, whose capital was Prusa
(Bursa), after conquering Nicomedia (1327) and Nicæa
(1330), threatened the Hellespont. He took the
title of Padishah, and his court was called the <span class="tei tei-q">“High
Porte.”</span> His son, Soliman, crossed the Hellespont
(1357), and took possession of Gallipoli and Sestos.
He thus became master of the Dardanelles. Murad I.
took Adrianople (1362), made it his capital, conquered
Macedonia, and, after a severe struggle, overthrew the
united forces of the Slavonic races south of the Danube,
the Bulgarians, Servians, and Kroatians, in the battle
of Kossova-polye (1389). He fell himself, but his successor
Bayazeth, followed his course, took Thessaly,
passed Thermopylæ, and devastated the Peloponnesus.
The Emperor of Germany, Sigismund, who advanced
at the head of an army composed of French, German,
and Slavonic soldiers, was defeated by Bayazeth on the
Danube in the battle of Nicopolis, 1399. Bayazeth
took Bosnia, and would have taken Constantinople, had
not the same Mongolians, who in 1244 drove the first
Turkish tribes westward into Persia, threatened again
their newly acquired possessions. Timur had grasped
the reins fallen from the hands of Chingis-khán: Bayazeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was compelled to meet him, and suffered defeat
(1402) in the battle of Angora (Ankyra) in Galatia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Europe now had respite, but not long; Timur died,
and with him his empire fell to pieces, while the Osmanic
army rallied again under Mahomet I. (1413),
and re-attained its former power under Murad II.
(1421). Successful in Asia, Murad sent his armies
back to the Danube, and after long-continued campaigns,
and powerful resistance from the Hungarians
and Slaves under Hunyad, he at last gained two decisive
victories; Varna in 1444, and Kossova in 1448.
Constantinople could no longer be held, and the Pope
endeavored in vain to rouse the chivalry of Western
Europe to a crusade against the Turks. Mahomet II.
succeeded in 1451, and on the 26th of May, 1453, Constantinople,
after a valiant resistance, fell, and became
the capital of the Turkish empire.

It is a real pleasure to read a Turkish grammar,
even though one may have no wish to acquire it practically.
The ingenious manner in which the numerous
grammatical forms are brought out, the regularity which
pervades the system of declension and conjugation, the
transparency and intelligibility of the whole structure,
must strike all who have a sense of that wonderful
power of the human mind which has displayed itself in
language. Given so small a number of graphic and demonstrative
roots as would hardly suffice to express
the commonest wants of human beings, to produce
an instrument that shall render the faintest shades
of feeling and thought;—given a vague infinitive or
a stern imperative, to derive from it such moods as
an optative or subjunctive, and tenses as an aorist
or paulo-post future;—given incoherent utterances, to
arrange them into a system where all is uniform and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regular, all combined and harmonious;—such is the
work of the human mind which we see realized in
<span class="tei tei-q">“language.”</span> But in most languages nothing of this
early process remains visible. They stand before us
like solid rocks, and the microscope of the philologist
alone can reveal the remains of organic life with which
they are built up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the grammar of the Turkic languages, on the contrary,
we have before us a language of perfectly transparent
structure, and a grammar the inner workings of
which we can study, as if watching the building of cells
in a crystal bee-hive. An eminent orientalist remarked
<span class="tei tei-q">“we might imagine Turkish to be the result of the deliberations
of some eminent society of learned men;”</span>
but no such society could have devised what the mind
of man produced, left to itself in the steppes of Tatary,
and guided only by its innate laws, or by an instinctive
power as wonderful as any within the realm
of nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us examine a few forms. <span class="tei tei-q">“To love,”</span> in the
most general sense of the word, or love, as a root, is in
Turkish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev</span></em>. This does not yet mean <span class="tei tei-q">“to love,”</span>
which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sevmek</span></em>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“love”</span> as a substantive, which is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sevgu</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sevi</span></em>; but it only expresses the general idea of
loving in the abstract. This root, as we remarked before,
can never be touched. Whatever syllables may
be added for the modification of its meaning, the root
itself must stand out in full prominence like a pearl set
in diamonds. It must never be changed or broken,
assimilated or modified, as in the English I fall, I fell,
I take, I took, I think, I thought, and similar forms.
With this one restriction, however, we are free to treat
it at pleasure.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us suppose we possessed nothing like our conjugation,
but had to express such ideas as I love, thou
lovest, and the rest, for the first time. Nothing would
seem more natural now than to form an adjective or a
participle, meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“loving,”</span> and then add the different
pronouns, as I loving, thou loving, &amp;c. Exactly
this the Turks have done. We need not inquire at
present how they produced what we call a participle.
It was a task, however, by no means so facile as we
now conceive it. In Turkish, one participle is formed
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">er</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sev</span></em>+<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">er</span></em> would, therefore, mean lov+er or
lov+ing. Thou, in Turkish, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sen</span></em>, and as all modificatory
syllables are placed at the end of the root, we
get <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-er-sen</span></em>, thou lovest. You in Turkish is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">siz</span></em>;
hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-er-siz</span></em>, you love. In these cases the pronouns
and the terminations of the verb coincide exactly. In
other persons the coincidences are less complete, because
the pronominal terminations have sometimes been
modified, or, as in the third person singular, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sever</span></em>,
dropped altogether as unnecessary. A reference to
other cognate languages, however, where either the
terminations or the pronouns themselves have maintained
a more primitive form, enables us to say that in
the original Turkish verb, all persons of the present
were formed by means of pronouns appended to this
participle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sever</span></em>. Instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“I love, thou lovest, he
loves,”</span> the Turkish grammarian says, <span class="tei tei-q">“lover-I, lover-thou,
lover.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But these personal terminations are not the same in

We need not inquire as yet into the origin of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">di</span></em>,
added to form the imperfect; but it should be stated
that in the first person plural of the imperfect a various
reading occurs in other Tataric dialects, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">miz</span></em>
is used there instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></em>. Now, looking at these terminations
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ñ</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">miz</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ñiz</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ler</span></em>, we find that they
are exactly the same as the possessive pronouns used
after nouns. As the Italian says <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fratelmo</span></em>, my brother,
and as in Hebrew we say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">El-i</span></em>, God (of) I, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> my
God, the Tataric languages form the phrases <span class="tei tei-q">“my
house, thy house, his house,”</span> by possessive pronouns
appended to substantives. A Turk says,—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may hence infer that in the imperfect these pronominal
terminations were originally taken in a possessive
sense, and that, therefore, what remains after
the personal terminations are removed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sever-di</span></em>, was
never an adjective or a participle, but must have been
originally a substantive capable of receiving terminal
possessive pronouns; that is, the idea originally expressed
by the imperfect could not have been <span class="tei tei-q">“loving-I,”</span>
but <span class="tei tei-q">“love of me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How then, could this convey the idea of a past tense
as contrasted with the present? Let us look to our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own language. If desirous to express the perfect, we
say, I have loved, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'ai aimé</span></em>. This <span class="tei tei-q">“I have,”</span> meant
originally, I possess, and in Latin <span class="tei tei-q">“amicus quem amatum
habeo,”</span> signified in fact a friend whom I hold dear,—not
as yet, whom I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> loved. In the course of
time, however, these phrases, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have said, I have
loved,”</span> took the sense of the perfect, and of time past—and
not unnaturally, inasmuch as what I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hold</span></em>, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> done, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> done;—done, as we say, and past. In
place of an auxiliary possessive verb, the Turkish language
uses an auxiliary possessive pronoun to the same
effect. <span class="tei tei-q">“Paying belonging to me,”</span> equals <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
paid;”</span> in either case a phrase originally possessive,
took a temporal signification, and became a past or
perfect tense. This, however, is the very anatomy of
grammar, and when a Turk says <span class="tei tei-q">“severdim”</span> he is,
of course, as unconscious of its literal force, <span class="tei tei-q">“loving
belonging to me,”</span> as of the circulation of his blood.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most ingenious part of Turkish is undoubtedly
the verb. Like Greek and Sanskrit, it exhibits a variety
of moods and tenses, sufficient to express the nicest
shades of doubt, of surmise, of hope, and supposition.
In all these forms the root remains intact, and sounds
like a key-note through all the various modulations
produced by the changes of person, number, mood, and
time. But there is one feature so peculiar to the Turkish
verb, that no analogy can be found in any of the
Aryan languages—the power of producing new verbal
bases by the mere addition of certain letters, which give
to every verb a negative, or causative, or reflexive, or
reciprocal meaning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sev-mek</span></em>, for instance, as a simple root, means to love.
By adding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, we obtain a reflexive verb, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-in-mek</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which means to love oneself, or rather, to rejoice, to
be happy. This may now be conjugated through all
moods and tenses, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sevin</span></em> being in every respect equal
to a new root. By adding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ish</span></em> we form a reciprocal
verb, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-ish-mek</span></em>, to love one another.

not to love. And if it is necessary to express the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hand to convey even that idea. Thus while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-me-mek</span></em>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Turkish grammarian is fain to subject it. It is clear,
however, that wherever a negation can be formed, the
idea of impossibility also can be superadded, so that by
substituting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eme</span></em> for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></em>, we should raise the number of
derivative roots to thirty-six. The very last of these,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">xxxvi.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sev-ish-dir-il-eme-mek</span></em> would
be perfectly intelligible,
and might be used, for instance, if, in speaking
of the Sultan and the Czar, we wished to say, that it
was impossible that they should be brought to love one
another.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Finnic Class.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is generally supposed that the original seat of the
Finnic tribes was in the Ural mountains, and their
languages have been therefore called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uralic</span></em>. From
this centre they spread east and west; and southward
in ancient times, even to the Black Sea, where Finnic
tribes, together with Mongolic and Turkic, were probably
known to the Greeks under the comprehensive
and convenient name of Scythians. As we possess no
literary documents of any of these nomadic nations, it
is impossible to say, even where Greek writers have
preserved their barbarous names, to what branch of
the vast Turanian family they belonged. Their habits
were probably identical before the Christian era, during
the Middle Ages, and at the present day. One tribe
takes possession of a tract and retains it perhaps for
several generations, and gives its name to the meadows
where it tends its flocks, and to the rivers where the
horses are watered. If the country be fertile, it will
attract the eye of other tribes; wars begin, and if resistance
be hopeless, hundreds of families fly from their
paternal pastures, to migrate perhaps for generations,—for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
migration they find a more natural life than permanent
habitation,—and after a time we may rediscover
their names a thousand miles distant. Or two
tribes will carry on their warfare for ages, till with
reduced numbers both have perhaps to make common
cause against some new enemy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During these continued struggles their languages
lose as many words as men are killed on the field of
battle. Some words (we might say) go over, others
are made prisoners, and exchanged again during times
of peace. Besides, there are parleys and challenges,
and at last a dialect is produced which may very properly
be called a language of the camp, (Urdu-zebán,
camp-language, is the proper name of Hindustání,
formed in the armies of the Mogul emperors,) but
where it is difficult for the philologist to arrange the
living and to number the slain, unless some salient
points of grammar have been preserved throughout the
medley. We saw how a number of tribes may be at
times suddenly gathered by the command of a Chingis-khán
or Timur, like billows heaving and swelling at
the call of a thunder-storm. One such wave rolling
on from Karakorum to Liegnitz may sweep away all the
sheepfolds and landmarks of centuries, and when the
storm is over, a thin crust will, as after a flood, remain,
concealing the underlying stratum of people and languages.

On the evidence of language, the Finnic stock is
divided into four branches,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Chudic branch comprises the Finnic of the Baltic
coasts. The name is derived from Chud (Tchud)
originally applied by the Russians to the Finnic nations
in the north-west of Russia. Afterwards it took
a more general sense, and was used almost synonymously
with Scythian for all the tribes of Central and
Northern Asia. The Finns, properly so called, or as
they call themselves Suomalainen, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> inhabitants of
fens, are settled in the provinces of Finland (formerly
belonging to Sweden, but since 1809 annexed to Russia),
and in parts of the governments of Archangel and
Olonetz. Their number is stated at 1,521,515. The
Finns are the most advanced of their whole family,
and are, the Magyars excepted, the only Finnic race
that can claim a station among the civilized and civilizing
nations of the world. Their literature and, above
all, their popular poetry bear witness to a high intellectual
development in times which we may call mythical,
and in places more favorable to the glow of poetical
feelings than their present abode, the last refuge
Europe could afford them. The epic songs still live
among the poorest, recorded by oral tradition alone,
and preserving all the features of a perfect metre and
of a more ancient language. A national feeling has
lately arisen amongst the Finns, despite of Russian supremacy,
and the labors of Sjögern, Lönnrot, Castrén,
and Kellgren, receiving hence a powerful impulse, have
produced results truly surprising. From the mouths
of the aged an epic poem has been collected equalling
the Iliad in length and completeness, nay, if we can
forget for a moment all that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> in our youth learned
to call beautiful, not less beautiful. A Finn is not a
Greek, and Wainamoinen was not a Homer. But if
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the poet may take his colors from that nature by which
he is surrounded, if he may depict the men with whom
he lives, <span class="tei tei-q">“Kalewala”</span> possesses merits not dissimilar from
those of the Iliad, and will claim its place as the fifth
national epic of the world, side by side with the Ionian
songs, with the Mahábhárata, the Shahnámeh, and the
Nibelunge. This early literary cultivation has not
been without a powerful influence on the language.
It has imparted permanency to its forms and a traditional
character to its words, so that at first sight we
might almost doubt whether the grammar of this language
had not left the agglutinative stage, and entered
into the current of inflection with Greek or Sanskrit.
The agglutinative type, however, yet remains, and its
grammar shows a luxuriance of grammatical combination
second only to Turkish and Hungarian. Like
Turkish it observes the <span class="tei tei-q">“harmony of vowels,”</span> a feature
peculiar to Turanian languages, as explained
before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Karelian and Tavastian are dialectical varieties of
Finnish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Esths or Esthonians, neighbors to the Finns,
speak a language closely allied to the Finnish. It is
divided into the dialects of Dorpat (in Livonia) and
Reval. Except some popular songs it is almost without
literature. Esthonia, together with Livonia and
Kurland, forms the three Baltic provinces of Russia.
The population on the islands of the Gulf of Finland
is mostly Esthonian. In the higher ranks of society
Esthonian is hardly understood, and never spoken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the Finns and Esthonians, the Livonians
and the Lapps must be reckoned also amongst the
same family. Their number, however, is small. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
population of Livonia consists chiefly of Esths, Letts,
Russians, and Germans. The number of Livonians
speaking their own dialect is not more than 5000.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lapps, or Laplanders, inhabit the most northern
part of Europe. They belong to Sweden and
Russia. Their number is estimated at 28,000. Their
language has lately attracted much attention, and Castrén's
travels give a description of their manners most
interesting from its simplicity and faithfulness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bulgaria branch comprises the Tcheremissians
and Mordvinians, scattered in disconnected colonies
along the Volga, and surrounded by Russian and Tataric
dialects. Both languages are extremely artificial
in their grammar, and allow an accumulation of pronominal
affixes at the end of verbs, surpassed only by
the Bask, the Caucasian, and those American dialects
that have been called Polysynthetic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The general name given to these tribes, Bulgaric,
is not borrowed from Bulgaria, on the Danube; Bulgaria,
on the contrary, received its name (replacing
Moesia) from the Finnic armies by whom it was conquered
in the seventh century. Bulgarian tribes advanced
from the Volga to the Don, and after remaining
for a time under the sovereignty of the Avars on
the Don and Dnieper, they advanced to the Danube in
635, and founded the Bulgarian kingdom. This has
retained its name to the present day, though the Finnic
Bulgarians have long been absorbed by Slavonic inhabitants,
and both brought under Turkish sway since
1392.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third, or Permic branch, comprises the idioms
of the Votiakes, the Sirianes, and the Permians,
three dialects of one language. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Perm</span></em> was the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
name for the country between 61°-76° <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">e.</span></span> lon. and
55°-65° <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">n.</span></span> lat. The Permic tribes were driven westward
by their eastern neighbors, the Voguls, and thus
pressed upon their western neighbors, the Bulgars
of the Volga. The Votiakes are found between the
rivers Vyatka and Kama. Northwards follow the
Sirianes, inhabiting the country on the Upper Kâma,
while the eastern portion is held by the Permians.
These are surrounded on the south by the Tatars of
Orenburg and the Bashkirs; on the north by the
Samoyedes, and on the east by Voguls, who pressed
on them from the Ural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These Voguls, together with Hungarians and Ostiakes,
form the fourth and last branch of the Finnic
family, the Ugric. It was in 462, after the dismemberment
of Attila's Hunnic empire that these Ugric
tribes approached Europe. They were then called
Onagurs, Saragurs, and Urogs; and in later times
they occur in Russian chronicles as Ugry. They are
the ancestors of the Hungarians, and should not be
confounded with the Uigurs, an ancient Turkic tribe
mentioned before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The similarity between the Hungarian language and
dialects of Finnic origin, spoken east of the Volga, is
not a new discovery. In 1253, Wilhelm Ruysbroeck,
a priest who travelled beyond the Volga, remarked
that a race called Pascatir, who live on the Yaïk,
spoke the same language as the Hungarians. They
were then settled east of the old Bulgarian kingdom,
the capital of which, the ancient Bolgari, on the left
of the Volga, may still be traced in the ruins of Spask.
If these Pascatir—the portion of the Ugric tribes that
remained east of the Volga—are identical with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bashkir, as Klaproth supposes, it would follow that,
in later times, they gave up their language, for the
present Bashkir no longer speak a Hungarian, but a
Turkic, dialect. The affinity of the Hungarian and
the Ugro-Finnic dialects was first proved philologically
by Gyarmathi in 1799.

We have thus examined the four chief classes of the
Turanian family, the Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic, and
Finnic. The Tungusic branch stands lowest; its grammar
is not much richer than Chinese, and in its structure
there is an absence of that architectonic order
which in Chinese makes the Cyclopean stones of language
hold together without cement. This applies,
however, principally to the Mandshu; other Tungusic
dialects spoken, not in China, but in the original seats
of the Mandshus, are even now beginning to develop
grammatical forms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mongolic dialects excel the Tungusic, but in
their grammar can hardly distinguish between the
different parts of speech. The spoken idioms of the
Mongolians, as of the Tungusians, are evidently struggling
towards a more organic life, and Castrén has
brought home evidence of incipient verbal growth in
the language of the Buriäts and a Tungusic dialect
spoken near Nyertchinsk.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is, however, only a small beginning, if compared
with the profusion of grammatical resources displayed
by the Turkic languages. In their system of
conjugation, the Turkic dialects can hardly be surpassed.
Their verbs are like branches which break
down under the heavy burden of fruits and blossoms.
The excellence of the Finnic languages consists rather
in a diminution than increase of verbal forms; but in
declension Finnish is even richer than Turkish.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These four classes, together with the Samoyedic,
constitute the northern or Ural-Altaic division of the
Turanian family.

of radical or monosyllabic speech. A few, such
as Japanese,<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>
the language of Korea, of the Koriakes,
the Kamchadales, and the numerous dialects of the
Caucasus, &amp;c., remain unclassed; but in them also
some traces of a common origin with the Turanian
languages have, it is probable, survived, and await the
discovery of philological research.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the third, or inflectional, stage, I need not say
much, as we have examined its structure when analyzing
in our former Lectures a number of words in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, or any other of the Aryan languages.
The chief distinction between an inflectional
and an agglutinative language consists in the fact that
agglutinative languages preserve the consciousness of
their roots, and therefore do not allow them to be affected
by phonetic corruption; and, though they have
lost the consciousness of the original meaning of their
terminations, they feel distinctly the difference between
the significative root, and the modifying elements.
Not so in the inflectional languages. There
the various elements which enter into the composition
of words, may become so welded together, and suffer
so much from phonetic corruption, that none but the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
educated would be aware of an original distinction
between root and termination, and none but the comparative
grammarian able to discover the seams that
separate the component parts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If you consider the character of our morphological
classification, you will see that this classification, differing
thereby from the genealogical, must be applicable
to all languages. Our classification exhausts all possibilities.
If the component elements of language are
roots, predicative and demonstrative, we cannot have
more than three combinations. Roots may either remain
roots without any modification; or secondly, they
may be joined so that one determines the other and
loses its independent existence; or thirdly, they may
be joined and be allowed to coalesce, so that both lose
their independent existence. The number of roots
which enter into the composition of a word makes no
difference, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to admit a
fourth class, sometimes called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">polysynthetic</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incorporating</span></em>,
including most of the American languages. As
long as in these sesquipedalian compounds, the significative
root remains distinct, they belong to the agglutinative
stage; as soon as it is absorbed by the terminations,
they belong to the inflectional stage. Nor is it necessary
to distinguish between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">synthetic</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analytical</span></em>
languages, including under the former name the ancient,
and under the latter the modern, languages of
the inflectional class. The formation of such phrases
as the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'aimerai</span></em>, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j'ai à aimer</span></em>, or the English,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I shall do</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou wilt do</span></em>, may be called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analytical</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphrastic</span></em>. But in their morphological nature these
phrases are still inflectional. If we analyze such a
phrase as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">je vivrai</span></em>, we find it was originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> (Sanskrit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aham</span></em>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vivere</span></em> (Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jîv-as-e</span></em>,
dat. neut.) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habeo</span></em>
(Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bhâ-vayâ-mi</span></em>); that is to say, we have a
number of words in which grammatical articulation
has been almost entirely destroyed, but has not been
cast off; whereas in Turanian languages grammatical
forms are produced by the combination of integral
roots, and the old and useless terminations are first discarded
before any new combination takes place.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the end of our morphological classification a
problem presents itself, which we might have declined
to enter upon if we had confined ourselves to a genealogical
classification. At the end of our genealogical
classification we had to confess that only a certain number
of languages had as yet been arranged genealogically,
and that therefore the time for approaching the
problem of the common origin of all languages had not
yet come. Now, however, although we have not specified
all languages which belong to the radical, the terminational,
and inflectional classes, we have clearly
laid it down as a principle, that all languages must fall
under one or the other of these three categories of
human speech. It would not be consistent, therefore,
to shrink from the consideration of a problem, which,
though beset with many difficulties, cannot be excluded
from the science of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us first see our problem clearly and distinctly.
The problem of the common origin of languages has
no necessary connection with the problem of the common
origin of mankind. If it could be proved that
languages had had different beginnings, this would in
nowise necessitate the admission of different beginnings
of the human race. For if we look upon language as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
natural to man, it might have broken out at different
times and in different countries among the scattered
descendants of one original pair; if, on the contrary,
language is to be treated as an artificial invention, there
is still less reason why each succeeding generation should
not have invented its own idiom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor would it follow, if it could be proved that all
the dialects of mankind point to one common source,
that therefore the human race must descend from one
pair. For language might have been the property of
one favored race, and have been communicated to the
other races in the progress of history.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The science of language and the science of ethnology
have both suffered most seriously from being
mixed up together. The classification of races and
languages should be quite independent of each other.
Races may change their languages, and history supplies
us with several instances where one race adopted
the language of another. Different languages, therefore,
may be spoken by one race, or the same language
may be spoken by different races; so that any attempt
at squaring the classification of races and tongues must
necessarily fail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, the problem of the common origin of languages
has no connection with the statements contained
in the Old Testament regarding the creation of man,
and the genealogies of the patriarchs. If our researches
led us to the admission of different beginnings
for the languages of mankind, there is nothing in the
Old Testament opposed to this view. For although
the Jews believed that for a time the whole earth was
of one language and of one speech, it has long been
pointed out by eminent divines, with particular reference
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the dialects of America, that new languages
might have arisen at later times. If, on the contrary,
we arrive at the conviction that all languages can be
traced back to one common source, we could never
think of transferring the genealogies of the Old Testament
to the genealogical classification of language.
The genealogies of the Old Testament refer to blood,
not to language, and as we know that people, without
changing their name, did frequently change their language,
it is clearly impossible that the genealogies of
the Old Testament should coincide with the genealogical
classification of languages. In order to avoid a
confusion of ideas, it would be preferable to abstain
altogether from using the same names to express relationship
of language which in the Bible are used to
express relationship of blood. It was usual formerly
to speak of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Japhetic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamitic</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Semitic</span></em>
languages. The first name has now been replaced by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aryan</span></em>, the
second by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">African</span></em>; and though the third is still retained,
it has received a scientific definition quite different
from the meaning which it would have in the Bible.
It is well to bear this in mind, in order to prevent not
only those who are forever attacking the Bible with
arrows that cannot reach it, but likewise those who
defend it with weapons they know not how to wield,
from disturbing in any way the quiet progress of the
science of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now look dispassionately at our problem.
The problem of the possibility of a common origin of
all languages naturally divides itself into two parts, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em>. We are to-day concerned
with the formal part only. We have examined all
possible forms which language can assume, and we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have now to ask, can we reconcile with these three
distinct forms, the radical, the terminational, and the
inflectional, the admission of one common origin of
human speech? I answer decidedly, Yes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief argument that has been brought forward
against the common origin of language is this, that no
monosyllabic or radical language has ever entered into
an agglutinative or terminational stage, and that no
agglutinative or terminational language has ever risen
to the inflectional stage. Chinese, it is said, is still
what it has been from the beginning; it has never
produced agglutinative or inflectional forms; nor has
any Turanian language ever given up the distinctive
feature of the terminational stage, namely, the integrity
of its roots.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In answer to this it should be pointed out that though
each language, as soon as it once becomes settled, retains
that morphological character which it had when it first
assumed its individual or national existence, it does not
lose altogether the power of producing grammatical
forms that belong to a higher stage. In Chinese, and
particularly in Chinese dialects, we find rudimentary
traces of agglutination. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">li</span></em> which I mentioned
before as the sign of the locative, has dwindled down
to a mere postposition, and a modern Chinese is no
more aware that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">li</span></em> meant originally interior, than the
Turanian is of the origin of his case-terminations.<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> In
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the spoken dialects of Chinese, agglutinative forms are
of more frequent occurrence. Thus, in the Shanghai
dialect, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wo</span></em> is to speak, as a verb; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">woda</span></em>, a word. Of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">woda</span></em> a genitive is formed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">woda-ka</span></em>,
a dative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pela woda</span></em>, an accusative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tang
woda</span></em>.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>
In agglutinative languages
again, we meet with rudimentary traces of inflection.
Thus in Tamil the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tûngu</span></em>, to sleep, has not retained
its full integrity in the derivative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tûkkam</span></em>, sleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I mention these instances, which might be greatly
multiplied, in order to show that there is nothing
mysterious in the tenacity with which each language
clings in general to that stage of grammar which it
had attained at the time of its first settlement. If a
family, or a tribe, or a nation, has once accustomed
itself to express its ideas according to one system of
grammar, that first mould remains and becomes
stronger with each generation. But, while Chinese
was arrested and became traditional in this very early
stage the radical, other dialects passed on through that
stage, retaining their pliancy. They were not arrested,
and did not become traditional or national, before those
who spoke them had learnt to appreciate the advantage
of agglutination. That advantage being once perceived,
a few single forms in which agglutination first showed
itself would soon, by that sense of analogy which is inherent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in language, extend their influence irresistibly.
Languages arrested in that stage would cling with
equal tenacity to the system of agglutination. A Chinese
can hardly understand how language is possible,
unless every syllable is significative; a Turanian despises
every idiom in which each word does not display
distinctly its radical and significative element; whereas,
we who are accustomed to the use of inflectional languages,
are proud of the very grammar which a Chinese
and Turanian would treat with contempt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fact, therefore, that languages, if once settled,
do not change their grammatical constitution, is no
argument against our theory, that every inflectional
language was once agglutinative, and every agglutinative
language was once monosyllabic. I call it a
theory, but it is more than a theory, for it is the only
possible way in which the realities of Sanskrit or any
other inflectional language can be explained. As far
as the formal part of language is concerned, we cannot
resist the conclusion that what is now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inflectional</span></em> was
formerly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agglutinative</span></em>, and what is now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agglutinative</span></em>
was at first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">radical</span></em>. The great stream of language
rolled on in numberless dialects, and changed its
grammatical coloring as it passed from time to time
through new deposits of thought. The different
channels which left the main current and became
stationary and stagnant, or, if you like, literary and
traditional, retained forever that coloring which the
main current displayed at the stage of their separation.
If we call the radical stage <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white</span></em>, the agglutinative
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">red</span></em>, and the inflectional <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blue</span></em>, then we may well
understand why the white channels should show hardly
a drop of red or blue, or why the red channels should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hardly betray a shadow of blue; and we shall be prepared
to find what we do find, namely, white tints in
the red, and white and red tints in the blue channels
of speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You will have perceived that in what I have said I
only argue for the possibility, not for the necessity, of a
common origin of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I look upon the problem of the common origin of
language, which I have shown to be quite independent
of the problem of the common origin of mankind, as
a question which ought to be kept open as long as possible.
It is not, I believe, a problem quite as hopeless
as that of the plurality of worlds, on which so much
has been written of late, but it should be treated very
much in the same manner. As it is impossible to demonstrate
by the evidence of the senses that the planets
are inhabited, the only way to prove that they
are, is to prove that it is impossible that they should
not be. Thus on the other hand, in order to prove
that the planets are not inhabited, you must prove
that it is impossible that they should be. As soon
as the one or the other has been proved, the question
will be set at rest: till then it must remain an
open question, whatever our own predilections on the
subject may be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not take quite as desponding a view of the
problem of the common origin of language, but I
insist on this, that we ought not to allow this problem
to be in any way prejudged. Now it has been the
tendency of the most distinguished writers on comparative
philology to take it almost for granted, that
after the discovery of the two families of language, the
Aryan and Semitic, and after the establishment of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
close ties of relationship which unite the members of
each, it would be impossible to admit any longer a
common origin of language. It was natural, after the
criteria by which the unity of the Aryan as well as the
Semitic dialects can be proved had been so successfully
defined, that the absence of similar coincidences between
any Semitic and Aryan language, or between
these and any other branch of speech, should have
led to a belief that no connection was admissible between
them. A Linnæan botanist, who has his definite
marks by which to recognize an Anemone, would reject
with equal confidence any connection between the species
Anemone and other flowers which have since been
classed under the same head though deficient in the
Linnæan marks of the Anemone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are surely different degrees of affinity in
languages as well as in all other productions of
nature, and the different families of speech, though
they cannot show the same signs of relationship by
which their members are held together, need not of
necessity have been perfect strangers to each other
from the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now I confess that when I found the argument
used over and over again, that it is impossible any
longer to speak of a common origin of language, because
comparative philology had proved that there
existed various families of language, I felt that this
was not true, that at all events it was an exaggeration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem, if properly viewed, bears the following
aspect:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">If you wish to assert that language
had various beginnings, you must prove it impossible
that language could have had a common origin.</span></em>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No such impossibility has ever been established
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with regard to a common origin of the Aryan and
Semitic dialects; while on the contrary the analysis
of the grammatical forms in either family has removed
many difficulties, and made it at least intelligible
how, with materials identical or very similar, two
individuals, or two families, or two nations, could in
the course of time have produced languages so different
in form as Hebrew and Sanskrit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But still greater light was thrown on the formative
and metamorphic process of language by the study of
other dialects unconnected with Sanskrit or Hebrew,
and exhibiting before our eyes the growth of those
grammatical forms (grammatical in the widest sense
of the word) which in the Aryan and Semitic families
we know only as formed, not as forming; as decaying,
not as living; as traditional, not as understood and
intentional: I mean the Turanian languages. The
traces by which these languages attest their original
relationship are much fainter than in the Semitic
and Aryan families, but they are so of necessity.
In the Aryan and Semitic families, the agglutinative
process, by which alone grammatical forms can be
obtained, has been arrested at some time, and this
could only have been through religious or political
influences. By the same power through which an
advancing civilization absorbs the manifold dialects
in which every spoken idiom naturally represents
itself, the first political or religious centralization
must necessarily have put a check on the exuberance
of an agglutinative speech. Out of many possible
forms one became popular, fixed, and technical for
each word, for each grammatical category; and by
means of poetry, law, and religion, a literary or political
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
language was produced to which thenceforth
nothing had to be added; which in a short time,
after becoming unintelligible in its formal elements,
was liable to phonetic corruption only, but incapable
of internal resuscitation. It is necessary to admit a
primitive concentration of this kind for the Aryan
and Semitic families, for it is thus only that we can
account for coincidences between Sanskrit and Greek
terminations, which were formed neither from Greek
nor from Sanskrit materials, but which are still identically
the same in both. It is in this sense that I
call these languages political or state languages, and
it has been truly said that languages belonging to
these families must be able to prove their relationship
by sharing in common not only what is regular
and intelligible, but what is anomalous, unintelligible,
and dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If no such concentration takes place, languages,
though formed of the same materials and originally
identical, must necessarily diverge in what we may
call dialects, but in a very different sense from the
dialects such as we find in the later periods of political
languages. The process of agglutination will continue
in each clan, and forms becoming unintelligible will be
easily replaced by new and more intelligible compounds.
If the cases are formed by postpositions, new postpositions
can be used as soon as the old ones become obsolete.
If the conjugation is formed by pronouns, new
pronouns can be used if the old ones are no longer sufficiently
distinct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us ask then, what coincidences we are likely to
find in agglutinative dialects which have become separated,
and which gradually approach to a more settled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
state? It seems to me that we can only expect to find
in them such coincidences as Castrén and Schott have
succeeded in discovering in the Finnic, Turkic, Mongolic,
Tungusic, and Samoyedic languages; and such as
Hodgson, Caldwell, Logan, and myself have pointed out
in the Tamulic, Gangetic, Lohitic, Taïc, and Malaïc languages.
They must refer chiefly to the radical materials
of language, or to those parts of speech which it
is most difficult to reproduce, I mean pronouns, numerals,
and prepositions. These languages will hardly
ever agree in what is anomalous or inorganic, because
their organism repels continually what begins to be formal
and unintelligible. It is astonishing rather, that
any words of a conventional meaning should have
been discovered as the common property of the Turanian
languages, than that most of their words and forms
should be peculiar to each. These coincidences must,
however, be accounted for by those who deny the common
origin of the Turanian languages; they must be
accounted for, either as the result of accident, or of an
imitative instinct which led the human mind everywhere
to the same onomatopoëtic formations. This has
never been done, and it will require great efforts to
achieve it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To myself the study of the Turanian family was interesting
particularly because it offered an opportunity
of learning how far languages, supposed to be of a common
origin, might diverge and become dissimilar by the
unrestrained operation of dialectic regeneration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a letter which I addressed to my friend, the late
Baron Bunsen, and which was published by him in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal History”</span><a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(vol. i. pp. 263-521), it had been my object to trace,
as far as I was able, the principles which guided the
formation of agglutinative languages, and to show how
far languages may become dissimilar in their grammar
and dictionary, and yet allow us to treat them as cognate
dialects. In answer to the assertion that it was
impossible, I tried, in the fourth, fifth, and sixth
sections of that Essay, to show <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> it was possible, that,
starting from a common ground, languages as different
as Mandshu and Finnish, Malay and Siamese, should
have arrived at their present state, and might still be
treated as cognate tongues. And as I look upon this
process of agglutination as the only intelligible means
by which language can acquire a grammatical organization,
and clear the barrier which has arrested the
growth of the Chinese idiom, I felt justified in applying
the principles derived from the formation of the
Turanian languages to the Aryan and Semitic families.
They also must have passed through an agglutinative
stage, and it is during that period alone that we can
account for the gradual divergence and individualization
of what we afterwards call the Aryan and Semitic
forms of speech. If we can account for the different
appearance of Mandshu and Finnish, we can also account
for the distance between Hebrew and Sanskrit.
It is true that we do not know the Aryan speech during
its agglutinative period, but we can infer what it
was when we see languages like Finnish and Turkish
approaching more and more to an Aryan type. Such
has been the advance which Turkish has made towards
inflectional forms, that Professor Ewald claims for it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the title of a synthetic language, a title which he gives
to the Aryan and Semitic dialects after they have left

phonetic corruption and dissolution. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many of its
component parts,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“though they were no
doubt originally, as in every language, independent

formal elements which Turkish shares in common with
the Aryan family, and which therefore could only date
from a period when both were still in their agglutinative
infancy. For instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">di</span></em>, as exponent of a past
action; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ta</span></em>, as the sign of the past participle of the passive;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lu</span></em>, as a suffix to form adjectives,

more than I should venture to assert.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Taking this view of the gradual formation of language
by agglutination, as opposed to intussusception,
it is hardly necessary to say that, if I speak of a
Turanian family of speech, I use the word family in a
different sense from that which it has with regard to
the Aryan and Semitic languages. In my Letter on
the Turanian languages, which has been the subject of
such fierce attacks from those who believe in different
beginnings of language and mankind, I had explained
this repeatedly, and I had preferred the term of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">group</span></em>
for the Turanian languages, in order to express as
clearly as possible that the relation between Turkish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Mandshu, between Tamil and Finnish, was a different
one, not in degree only, but in kind, from that
between Sanskrit and Greek. <span class="tei tei-q">“These Turanian languages,”</span>
I said (p. 216), <span class="tei tei-q">“cannot be considered as
standing to each other in the same relation as Hebrew
and Arabic, Sanskrit and Greek.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“They are radii
diverging from a common centre, not children of a
common parent.”</span> And still they are not so widely
distant as Hebrew and Sanskrit, because none of them
has entered into that new phase of growth or decay
(p. 218) through which the Semitic and Aryan languages
passed after they had been settled, individualized,
and nationalized.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The real object of my Essay was therefore a defensive
one. It was to show how rash it was to speak of
different independent beginnings in the history of human
speech, before a single argument had been brought
forward to establish the necessity of such an admission.
The impossibility of a common origin of language has
never been proved, but, in order to remove what were
considered difficulties affecting the theory of a common
origin, I felt it my duty to show practically, and by the
very history of the Turanian languages, how such a
theory was possible, or as I say in one instance only,
probable. I endeavored to show how even the most distant
members of the Turanian family, the one spoken
in the north, the other in the south of Asia, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Finnic</span></em>
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tamulic</span></em>, have preserved in their grammatical
organization traces of a former unity; and, if my opponents
admit that I have proved the ante-Brahmanic
or Tamulic inhabitants of India to belong to the Turanian
family, they can hardly have been aware that if
this, the most extreme point of my argument be conceded,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
everything else is involved, and must follow by
necessity.

It will be seen, from the very wording of these two
paragraphs, that my object was to deny the necessity
of independent beginnings, and to assert the possibility
of a common origin of language. I have been accused
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of having been biassed in my researches by an implicit
belief in the common origin of mankind. I do not
deny that I hold this belief, and, if it wanted confirmation,
that confirmation has been supplied by Darwin's
book <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Origin of Species.”</span><a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> But I defy my
adversaries to point out one single passage where I
have mixed up scientific with theological arguments.
Only if I am told that no <span class="tei tei-q">“quiet observer would ever
have conceived the idea of deriving all mankind from
one pair, unless the Mosaic records had taught it,”</span> I
must be allowed to say in reply, that this idea on the
contrary is so natural, so consistent with all human
laws of reasoning, that, as far as I know, there has
been no nation on earth which, if it possessed any traditions
on the origin of mankind, did not derive the
human race from one pair, if not from one person.
The author of the Mosaic records, therefore, though
stripped, before the tribunal of Physical Science, of his
claims as an inspired writer, may at least claim the
modest title of a quiet observer, and if his conception
of the physical unity of the human race can be proved
to be an error, it is an error which he shares in common
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with other quiet observers, such as Humboldt,

The only question which remains to be answered is
this, Was it one and the same volume of water which
supplied all the lateral channels of speech? or, to drop
all metaphor, are the roots which were joined together
according to the radical, the terminational, and inflectional
systems, identically the same? The only way to
answer, or at least to dispose of, this question is to consider
the nature and origin of roots; and we shall then
have reached the extreme limits to which inductive
reasoning can carry us in our researches into the mysteries
of human speech.

This quotation from an eminent Scotch philosopher

the problem which we have to examine to-day, namely,
the origin of language. Though we have stripped that

of the human understanding.

If we were asked the riddle how images of the eye
and all the sensations of our senses could be represented
by sounds, nay, could be so embodied in sounds
as to express thought and excite thought, we should
probably give it up as the question of a madman, who,
mixing up the most heterogeneous subjects, attempted
to change color into sound and sound into thought.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a>
Yet this is the riddle which we have now to solve.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is quite clear that we have no means of solving the
problem of the origin of language <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historically</span></em>, or of explaining
it as a matter of fact which happened once in
a certain locality and at a certain time. History does
not begin till long after mankind had acquired the
power of language, and even the most ancient traditions
are silent as to the manner in which man came in possession
of his earliest thoughts and words. Nothing,
no doubt, would be more interesting than to know
from historical documents the exact process by which
the first man began to lisp his first words, and thus to
be rid forever of all the theories on the origin of speech.
But this knowledge is denied us; and, if it had been
otherwise, we should probably be quite unable to understand
those primitive events in the history of the
human mind.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> We are told that the first man was the
son of God, that God created him in His own image,
formed him of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life. These are simple
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
facts, and to be accepted as such; if we begin to reason
on them, the edge of the human understanding glances
off. Our mind is so constituted that it cannot apprehend
the absolute beginning or the absolute end of
anything. If we tried to conceive the first man created
as a child, and gradually unfolding his physical and
mental powers, we could not understand his living for
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> day without supernatural aid. If, on the contrary,
we tried to conceive the first man created full-grown in
body and mind, the conception of an effect without a
cause, of a full-grown mind without a previous growth,
would equally transcend our reasoning powers. It is
the same with the first beginnings of language. Theologians
who claim for language a divine origin drift into
the most dangerous anthropomorphism, when they enter
into any details as to the manner in which they
suppose the Deity to have compiled a dictionary and
grammar in order to teach them to the first man, as a
schoolmaster teaches the deaf and dumb. And they do
not see that, even if all their premises were granted,
they would have explained no more than how the first
man might have learnt a language, if there was a language
ready made for him. How that language was
made would remain as great a mystery as ever. Philosophers,
on the contrary, who imagine that the first man,
though left to himself, would gradually have emerged
from a state of mutism and have invented words for
every new conception that arose in his mind, forget
that man could not by his own power have acquired <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
faculty</span></em> of speech which is the distinctive character of
mankind,<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> unattained and unattainable by the mute
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
creation. It shows a want of appreciation as to the
real bearings of our problem, if philosophers appeal to
the fact that children are born without language, and
gradually emerge from mutism to the full command of
articulate speech. We want no explanation how birds
learn to fly, created as they are with organs adapted to
that purpose. Nor do we wish to inquire how children
learn to use the various faculties with which the human
body and soul are endowed. We want to gain, if possible,
an insight into the original faculty of speech; and
for that purpose I fear it is as useless to watch the first
stammerings of children, as it would be to repeat the
experiment of the Egyptian king who intrusted two
new-born infants to a shepherd, with the injunction to
let them suck a goat's milk, and to speak no word in
their presence, but to observe what word they would
first utter.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> The same experiment is said to have been
repeated by the Swabian emperor, Frederic II., by
James IV. of Scotland, and by one of the Mogul emperors
of India. But, whether for the purpose of finding
out which was the primitive language of mankind,
or of discovering how far language was natural to man,
the experiments failed to throw any light on the problem
before us. Children, in learning to speak, do not
invent language. Language is there ready made for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them. It has been there for thousands of years. They
acquire the use of a language, and, as they grow up,
they may acquire the use of a second and a third. It
is useless to inquire whether infants, left to themselves,
would invent a language. It would be impossible, unnatural,
and illegal to try the experiment, and, without
repeated experiments, the assertions of those who believe
and those who disbelieve the possibility of children inventing
a language of their own, are equally valueless.
All we know for certain is, that an English child, if
left to itself, would never begin to speak English, and
that history supplies no instance of any language having
thus been invented.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we want to gain an insight into the faculty of
flying, which is a characteristic feature of birds, all
we can do is, first, to compare the structure of birds
with that of other animals which are devoid of that
faculty, and secondly, to examine the conditions under
which the act of flying becomes possible. It is the
same with speech. Speech is a specific faculty of man.
It distinguishes man from all other creatures; and if
we wish to acquire more definite ideas as to the real
nature of human speech, all we can do is to compare
man with those animals that seem to come nearest to
him, and thus to try to discover what he shares in
common with these animals, and what is peculiar to
him and to him alone. After we have discovered this,
we may proceed to inquire into the conditions under
which speech becomes possible, and we shall then have
done all that we can do, considering that the instruments
of our knowledge, wonderful as they are, are
yet far too weak to carry us into all the regions to
which we may soar on the wings of our imagination.

In comparing man with the other animals, we need
not enter here into the physiological questions whether
the difference between the body of an ape and the body
of a man is one of degree or of kind. However that
question is settled by physiologists we need not be
afraid. If the structure of a mere worm is such as
to fill the human mind with awe, if a single glimpse
which we catch of the infinite wisdom displayed in the
organs of the lowest creature gives us an intimation of
the wisdom of its Divine Creator far transcending the
powers of our conception, how are we to criticise and
disparage the most highly organized creatures of His
creation, creatures as wonderfully made as we ourselves?
Are there not many creatures on many points
more perfect even than man? Do we not envy the
lion's strength, the eagle's eye, the wings of every
bird? If there existed animals altogether as perfect
as man in their physical structure, nay, even more perfect,
no thoughtful man would ever be uneasy. His
true superiority rests on different grounds. <span class="tei tei-q">“I confess,”</span>
Sydney Smith writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“I feel myself so much
at ease about the superiority of mankind—I have
such a marked and decided contempt for the understanding
of every baboon I have ever seen—I feel
so sure that the blue ape without a tail will never
rival us in poetry, painting, and music, that I see no
reason whatever that justice may not be done to the
few fragments of soul and tatters of understanding
which they may really possess.”</span> The playfulness of
Sydney Smith in handling serious and sacred subjects
has of late been found fault with by many: but humor
is a safer sign of strong convictions and perfect
safety than guarded solemnity.

With regard to our own problem, no one can doubt
that certain animals possess all the physical requirements
for articulate speech. There is no letter of the
alphabet which a parrot will not learn to pronounce.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a>
The fact, therefore, that the parrot is without a language
of his own, must be explained by a difference
between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental</span></em>, not between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>, faculties
of the animal and man; and it is by a comparison of
the mental faculties alone, such as we find them in
man and brutes, that we may hope to discover what
constitutes the indispensable qualification for language,
a qualification to be found in man alone, and in no
other creature on earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental faculties</span></em>, and I mean to claim a large
share of what we call our mental faculties for the
higher animals. These animals have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensation</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>, only we must restrict
intellect to the comparing or interlacing of single
perceptions. All these points can be proved by irrefragable
evidence, and that evidence has never, I believe,
been summed up with greater lucidity and power
than in one of the last publications of M. P. Flourens,
<span class="tei tei-q">“De la Raison, du Génie, et de la Folie:”</span> Paris,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1861. There are no doubt many people who are as
much frightened at the idea that brutes have souls and
are able to think, as by <span class="tei tei-q">“the blue ape without a tail.”</span>
But their fright is entirely of their own making. If
people will use such words as soul or thought without
making it clear to themselves and others what they
mean by them, these words will slip away under their
feet, and the result must be painful. If we once ask
the question, Have brutes a soul? we shall never arrive
at any conclusion; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soul</span></em> has been so many times
defined by philosophers from Aristotle down to Hegel,
that it means everything and nothing. Such has been
the confusion caused by the promiscuous employment
of the ill-defined terms of mental philosophy that we
find Descartes representing brutes as living machines,
whereas Leibniz claims for them not only souls, but
immortal souls. <span class="tei tei-q">“Next to the error of those who
deny the existence of God,”</span> says Descartes, <span class="tei tei-q">“there
is none so apt to lead weak minds from the right path
of virtue, as to think that the soul of brutes is of the
same nature as our own; and, consequently, that we
have nothing to fear or to hope after this life, any more
than flies or ants; whereas, if we know how much they
differ, we understand much better that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> soul is quite
independent of the body, and consequently not subject
to die with the body.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spirit of these remarks is excellent, but the argument
is extremely weak. It does not follow that
brutes have no souls because they have no human
souls. It does not follow that the souls of men are
not immortal, because the souls of brutes are not immortal;
nor has the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">major premiss</span></em> ever been proved by
any philosopher, namely, that the souls of brutes must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessarily be destroyed and annihilated by death.
Leibniz, who has defended the immortality of the human
soul with stronger arguments than even Descartes,
writes:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I found at last how the souls of brutes and
their sensations do not at all interfere with the immortality
of human souls; on the contrary, nothing serves
better to establish our natural immortality than to believe
that all souls are imperishable.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of entering into these perplexities, which are
chiefly due to the loose employment of ill-defined terms,
let us simply look at the facts. Every unprejudiced
observer will admit that—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Brutes see, hear, taste, smell, and feel; that is to
say, they have five senses, just like ourselves, neither
more nor less. They have both sensation and perception,
a point which has been illustrated by M. Flourens
by the most interesting experiments. If the roots of
the optic nerve are removed, the retina in the eye of
a bird ceases to be excitable, the iris is no longer movable;
the animal is blind, because it has lost the organ
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensation</span></em>. If, on the contrary, the cerebral lobes are
removed, the eye remains pure and sound, the retina
excitable, the iris movable. The eye is preserved, yet
the animal cannot see, because it has lost the organs of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Brutes have sensations of pleasure and pain. A
dog that is beaten behaves exactly like a child that is
chastised, and a dog that is fed and fondled exhibits the
same signs of satisfaction as a boy under the same circumstances.
We can only judge from signs, and if
they are to be trusted in the case of children, they
must be trusted likewise in the case of brutes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Brutes do not forget, or as philosophers would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
say, brutes have memory. They know their masters,
they know their home; they evince joy on recognizing
those who have been kind to them, and they bear
malice for years to those by whom they have been insulted
or ill-treated. Who does not recollect the dog
Argos in the Odyssey, who, after so many years' absence,
was the first to recognize Ulysses?<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Brutes are able to compare and to distinguish.
A parrot will take up a nut, and throw it down again,
without attempting to crack it. He has found that it
is light; this he could discover only by comparing the
weight of the good nuts with that of the bad: and he
has found that it has no kernel; this he could discover
only by what philosophers would dignify with the
grand title of syllogism, namely, <span class="tei tei-q">“all light nuts are
hollow; this is a light nut, therefore this nut is hollow.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Brutes have a will of their own. I appeal to any
one who has ever ridden a restive horse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Brutes show signs of shame and pride. Here
again any one who has to deal with dogs, who has
watched a retriever with sparkling eyes placing a partridge
at his master's feet, or a hound slinking away
with his tail between his legs from the huntsman's
call, will agree that these signs admit of but one interpretation.
The difficulty begins when we use philosophical
language, when we claim for brutes a moral
sense, a conscience, a power of distinguishing good and
evil; and, as we gain nothing by these scholastic terms,
it is better to avoid them altogether.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Brutes show signs of love and hatred. There
are well-authenticated stories of dogs following their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
masters to the grave, and refusing food from any one.
Nor is there any doubt that brutes will watch their
opportunity till they revenge themselves on those whom
they dislike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, with all these facts before us, we deny that brutes
have sensation, perception, memory, will, and intellect,
we ought to bring forward powerful arguments for interpreting
the signs which we observe in brutes so differently
from those which we observe in men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some philosophers imagine they have explained everything,
if they ascribe to brutes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instinct</span></em> instead of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>. But, if we take these two words in their
usual acceptations, they surely do not exclude each
other.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> There are instincts in man as well as in brutes.
A child takes his mother's breast by instinct; the
spider weaves its net by instinct; the bee builds her
cell by instinct. No one would ascribe to the child a
knowledge of physiology because it employs the exact
muscles which are required for sucking; nor shall we
claim for the spider a knowledge of mechanics, or for
the bee an acquaintance with geometry, because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em>
could not do what they do without a study of these
sciences. But what if we tear a spider's web, and see
the spider examining the mischief that is done, and
either giving up his work in despair, or endeavoring to
mend it as well as may be?<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> Surely here we have
the instinct of weaving controlled by observation,
by comparison, by reflection, by judgment. Instinct,
whether mechanical or moral, is more prominent in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
brutes than in man; but it exists in both, as much as
intellect is shared by both.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where, then, is the difference between brute and
man?<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>
What is it that man can do, and of which
we find no signs, no rudiments, in the whole brute
world? I answer without hesitation: the one great
barrier between the brute and man is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Language</span></em>. Man
speaks, and no brute has ever uttered a word. Language
is our Rubicon, and no brute will dare to cross
it. This is our matter of fact answer to those who
speak of development, who think they discover the rudiments
at least of all human faculties in apes, and who
would fain keep open the possibility that man is only
a more favored beast, the triumphant conqueror in the
primeval struggle for life. Language is something
more palpable than a fold of the brain, or an angle of
the skull. It admits of no cavilling, and no process of
natural selection will ever distill significant words out
of the notes of birds or the cries of beasts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Language, however, is only the outward sign. We
may point to it in our arguments, we may challenge
our opponent to produce anything approaching to it
from the whole brute world. But if this were all, if
the art of employing articulate sounds for the purpose
of communicating our impressions were the only thing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by which we could assert our superiority over the
brute creation, we might not unreasonably feel somewhat
uneasy at having the gorilla so close on our
heels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It cannot be denied that brutes, though they do not
use articulate sounds for that purpose, have nevertheless
means of their own for communicating with each
other. When a whale is struck, the whole shoal,
though widely dispersed, are instantly made aware of
the presence of an enemy; and when the grave-digger
beetle finds the carcass of a mole, he hastens to communicate
the discovery to his fellows, and soon returns
with his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> confederates.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> It is evident, too, that
dogs, though they do not speak, possess the power of
understanding much that is said to them, their names
and the calls of their master; and other animals, such
as the parrot, can pronounce every articulate sound.
Hence, although for the purpose of philosophical warfare,
articulate language would still form an impregnable
position, yet it is but natural that for our own satisfaction
we should try to find out in what the strength
of our position really consists; or, in other words, that
we should try to discover that inward power of which
language is the outward sign and manifestation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For this purpose it will be best to examine the
opinions of those who approached our problem from
another point; who, instead of looking for outward
and palpable signs of difference between brute and
man, inquired into the inward mental faculties, and
tried to determine the point where man transcends
the barriers of the brute intellect. That point, if
truly determined, ought to coincide with the starting-point
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of language: and, if so, that coincidence ought
to explain the problem which occupies us at present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall read an extract from Locke's Essay concerning
Human Understanding.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After having explained how universal ideas are
made, how the mind, having observed the same color
in chalk, and snow, and milk, comprehends these single
perceptions under the general conception of whiteness,
Locke continues:<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If it may be doubted, whether
beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to
any degree: this, I think, I may be positive in, that
the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and
that the having of general ideas is that which puts a
perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an
excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no
means attain to.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If Locke is right in considering the having general
ideas as the distinguishing feature between man and
brutes, and, if we ourselves are right in pointing to
language as the one palpable distinction between the
two, it would seem to follow that language is the outward
sign and realization of that inward faculty which
is called the faculty of abstraction, but which is better
known to us by the homely name of Reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now look back to the result of our former
Lectures. It was this. After we had explained everything
in the growth of language that can be explained,
there remained in the end, as the only inexplicable residuum,
what we called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">roots</span></em>. These roots formed the
constituent elements of all languages. This discovery
has simplified the problem of the origin of language
immensely. It has taken away all excuse for those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rapturous descriptions of language which invariably
preceded the argument that language must have a
divine origin. We shall hear no more of that wonderful
instrument which can express all we see, and
hear, and taste, and touch, and smell; which is the
breathing image of the whole world; which gives form
to the airy feelings of our souls, and body to the loftiest
dreams of our imagination; which can arrange in accurate
perspective the past, the present, and the future,
and throw over everything the varying hues of certainty,
of doubt, of contingency. All this is perfectly
true, but it is no longer wonderful, at least not in the
Arabian Nights sense of that word. <span class="tei tei-q">“The speculative
mind,”</span> as Dr. Ferguson says, <span class="tei tei-q">“in comparing the first
and last steps of the progress of language, feels the
same sort of amazement with a traveller, who, after
rising insensibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look
from a precipice of an almost unfathomable depth to
the summit of which he scarcely believes himself to
have ascended without supernatural aid.”</span> To certain
minds it is a disappointment to be led down again by
the hand of history from that high summit. They
prefer the unintelligible which they can admire, to the
intelligible which they can only understand. But to a
mature mind reality is more attractive than fiction, and
simplicity more wonderful than complication. Roots
may seem dry things as compared with the poetry of
Goethe. Yet there is something more truly wonderful
in a root than in all the lyrics of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What, then, are these roots? In our modern languages
roots can only be discovered by scientific analysis,
and, even as far back as Sanskrit, we may say
that no root was ever used as a noun or as a verb.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But originally roots were thus used, and in Chinese we
have fortunately preserved to us a representative of
that primitive radical stage which, like the granite,
underlies all other strata of human speech. The
Aryan root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">DÂ</span></em>, to give, appears in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dâ-nam</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">donum</span></em>, gift, as a substantive; in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em>,
Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dadâmi</span></em>,
Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">di-dō-mi</span></em>, I give, as a verb; but the root DÂ
can never be used by itself. In Chinese, on the contrary,
the root TA, as such, is used in the sense of a
noun, greatness; of a verb, to be great; of an adverb,
greatly or much. Roots therefore are not, as is commonly
maintained, merely scientific abstractions, but
they were used originally as real words. What we
want to find out is this, What inward mental phase
is it that corresponds to these roots, as the germs of
human speech?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two theories have been started to solve this problem,
which, for shortness' sake, I shall call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bow-wow
theory</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pooh-pooh theory</span></em>.<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the first, roots are imitations of sounds,
according to the second, they are involuntary interjections.
The first theory was very popular among the
philosophers of the eighteenth century, and, as it is still
held by many distinguished scholars and philosophers,
we must examine it more carefully. It is supposed
then that man, being as yet mute, heard the voices of
birds and dogs and cows, the thunder of the clouds,
the roaring of the sea, the rustling of the forest, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
murmurs of the brook, and the whisper of the breeze.
He tried to imitate these sounds, and finding his
mimicking cries useful as signs of the objects from
which they proceeded, he followed up the idea and
elaborated language. This view was most ably defended
by Herder.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Man,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“shows conscious
reflection when his soul acts so freely that it
may separate, in the ocean of sensations which rush
into it through the senses, one single wave, arrest it,
regard it, being conscious all the time of regarding this
one single wave. Man proves his conscious reflection
when, out of the dream of images that float past his
senses, he can gather himself up and wake for a moment,
dwelling intently on one image, fixing it with a
bright and tranquil glance, and discovering for himself
those signs by which he knows that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> image
and no other. Man proves his conscious reflection
when he not only perceives vividly and distinctly all
the features of an object, but is able to separate and
recognize one or more of them as its distinguishing
features.”</span> For instance, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man sees a lamb. He
does not see it like the ravenous wolf. He is not
disturbed by any uncontrollable instinct. He wants
to know it, but he is neither drawn towards it nor
repelled from it by his senses. The lamb stands before
him, as represented by his senses, white, soft,
woolly. The conscious and reflecting soul of man
looks for a distinguishing mark;—the lamb bleats!—the
mark is found. The bleating which made the
strongest impression, which stood apart from all other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
impressions of sight or touch, remains in the soul.
The lamb returns—white, soft, woolly. The soul
sees, touches, reflects, looks for a mark. The lamb
bleats, and now the soul has recognized it. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah,
thou art the bleating animal,’</span> the soul says within
herself; and the sound of bleating, perceived as the
distinguishing mark of the lamb, becomes the name
of the lamb. It was the comprehended mark, the
word. And what is the whole of our language but
a collection of such words?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our answer is, that though there are names in
every language formed by mere imitation of sound, yet
these constitute a very small proportion of our dictionary.
They are the playthings, not the tools, of language,
and any attempt to reduce the most common
and necessary words to imitative roots ends in complete
failure. Herder himself, after having most strenuously
defended this theory of Onomatopoieia, as it is called,
and having gained a prize which the Berlin Academy
had offered for the best essay on the origin of language,
renounced it openly towards the latter years of his life,
and threw himself in despair into the arms of those
who looked upon languages as miraculously revealed.
We cannot deny the possibility that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> language might
have been formed on the principle of imitation; all we
say is, that as yet no language has been discovered
that was so formed. An Englishman in China,<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a> seeing
a dish placed before him about which he felt
suspicious, and wishing to know whether it was a
duck, said, with an interrogative accent,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quack quack?</span></em>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He received the clear and straightforward answer,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bow-wow!</span></em>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, no doubt, was as good as the most eloquent
conversation on the same subject between an Englishman
and a French waiter. But I doubt whether it
deserves the name of language. We do not speak of
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bow-wow</span></em>, but of a dog. We speak of a cow, not of
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moo</span></em>. Of a lamb, not of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">baa</span></em>. It is the same in
more ancient languages, such as Greek, Latin, and
Sanskrit. If this principle of Onomatopoieia is applicable
anywhere, it would be in the formation of the
names of animals. Yet we listen in vain for any similarity
between goose and cackling, hen and clucking,
duck and quacking, sparrow and chirping, dove and
cooing, hog and grunting, cat and mewing, between
dog and barking, yelping, snarling, or growling.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are of course some names, such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em>,
which are clearly formed by an imitation of sound.
But words of this kind are, like artificial flowers,
without a root. They are sterile, and are unfit to
express anything beyond the one object which they
imitate. If you remember the variety of derivatives
that could be formed from the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spac</span></em>, to see, you
will at once perceive the difference between the fabrication
of such a word as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em>, and the true natural
growth of words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us compare two words such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raven</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cuckoo</span></em> in English is clearly a mere imitation
of the cry of that bird, even more so than the corresponding
terms in Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin. In
these languages the imitative element has received the
support of a derivative suffix; we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kokila</span></em> in Sanskrit,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kokkyx</span></em> in Greek, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuculus</span></em> in
Latin.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cuckoo</span></em>
is, in fact, a modern word, which has taken the place
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">geac</span></em>, the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gauch</span></em>, and,
being purely onomatopoëtic, it is of course not liable
to the changes of Grimm's Law. As the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em>
predicates nothing but the sound of a particular bird, it
could never be applied for expressing any general quality
in which other animals might share; and the only
derivatives to which it might give rise are words expressive
of a metaphorical likeness with the bird. The
same applies to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cock</span></em>, the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kukkuṭa</span></em>. Here, too,
Grimm's Law does not apply, for both words were
intended to convey merely the cackling sound of the
bird; and, as this intention continued to be felt,
phonetic change was less likely to set in. The Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kukkuṭa</span></em> is not derived from any root, it simply repeats
the cry of the bird, and the only derivatives to which
it gives rise are metaphorical expressions, such as the
French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coquet</span></em>, originally strutting about like a cock;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coquetterie</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cocart</span></em>, conceited;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cocarde</span></em>, a cockade; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coquelicot</span></em>,
originally a cock's comb, then the wild red
poppy, likewise so called from its similarity with a
cock's comb.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now examine the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raven</span></em>. It might
seem at first, as if this also was merely onomatopoëtic.
Some people imagine they perceive a kind
of similarity between the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raven</span></em> and the cry of
that bird. This seems still more so if we compare
the Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hrafn</span></em>, the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rabe</span></em>, Old High-German
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hraban</span></em>. The Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kârava</span></em> also, the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corvus</span></em>, and the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">korōnē</span></em>, all are supposed to show
some similarity with the unmelodious sound of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Maître
Corbeau</span></em>. But as soon as we analyze the word we find
that it is of a different structure from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cock</span></em>.
It is derived from a root which has a general predicative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
power. The root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ru</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kru</span></em> is not a mere imitation
of the cry of the raven; it embraces many cries, from
the harshest to the softest, and it might have been
applied to the nightingale as well as to the raven. In
Sanskrit this root exists as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ru</span></em>, a verb which is applied
to the murmuring sound of rivers as well as to the
barking of dogs and the mooing of cows. From it are
derived numerous words in Sanskrit. In Latin we find
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raucus</span></em>, hoarse; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rumor</span></em>, a whisper; in German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rûnen</span></em>,
to speak low, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">runa</span></em>, mystery. The Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lamentum</span></em>
stands for an original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ravimentum</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cravimentum</span></em>.
This root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ru</span></em> has several secondary forms, such as the Sanskrit
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rud</span></em>, to cry; the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rug</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rugire</span></em>, to howl;
the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kru</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">klu</span></em>, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">klaiō</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">klausomai</span></em>; the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kruś</span></em>, to shout; the Gothic
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hrukjan</span></em>, to crow, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hropjan</span></em>,
to cry; the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rufen</span></em>. Even the common
Aryan word for hearing is closely allied to this root.
It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">śru</span></em> in Sanskrit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">klyō</span></em> in Greek, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cluo</span></em> in
Latin; and before it took the recognized meaning of hearing, it
meant to sound, to ring. When a noise was to be
heard in a far distance, the man who first perceived
it might well have said I ring, for his ears were
sounding and ringing; and the same verb, if once
used as a transitive, expressed exactly what we mean
by I hear a noise.

You will have perceived thus that the process which
led to the formation of the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kârava</span></em> in Sanskrit
is quite distinct from that which produced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cuckoo</span></em>.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kârava</span></em><a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> means a shouter, a caller, a crier. It might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have been applied to many birds; but it became the
traditional and recognized name for the crow. Cuckoo
could never mean anything but the cuckoo, and while
a word like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raven</span></em> has ever so many relations from a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rumor</span></em> down to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a row</span></em>, cuckoo stands by itself like a
stick in a living hedge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is curious to observe how apt we are to deceive
ourselves when we once adopt this system of Onomatopoieia.
Who does not imagine that he hears in the
word <span class="tei tei-q">“thunder”</span> an imitation of the rolling and rumbling
noise which the old Germans ascribed to their
God Thor playing at nine-pins? Yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thunder</span></em> is
clearly the same word as the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tonitru</span></em>. The root
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tan</span></em>, to stretch. From this root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tan</span></em>, we have in
Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tonos</span></em>, our tone, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tone</span></em> being produced by the
stretching and vibrating of cords. In Sanskrit the
sound thunder is expressed by the same root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tan</span></em>, but
in the derivatives <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tanyu</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tanyatu</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tanayitnu</span></em>,
thundering, we perceive no trace of the rumbling noise
which we imagined we perceived in the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tonitru</span></em>
and the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thunder</span></em>. The very same root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tan</span></em>, to
stretch, yields some derivatives which are anything but
rough and noisy. The English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tender</span></em>, the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tendre</span></em>,
the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tener</span></em>, are derived from it. Like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tenuis</span></em>,
the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tanu</span></em>, the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thin</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tener</span></em> meant
originally what was extended over a larger surface, then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thin</span></em>, then
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">delicate</span></em>. The relationship betwixt <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tender</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thin</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thunder</span></em> would be hard to establish if the
original conception of thunder had really been its
rumbling noise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who does not imagine that he hears something sweet
in the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sucre</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sucré</span></em>? Yet sugar came from India,
and it is there called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">śarkhara</span></em>, which is anything
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but sweet sounding. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">śarkhara</span></em> is the same word
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sugar</span></em>; it was called in Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saccharum</span></em>, and we
still speak of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saccharine</span></em> juice, which is sugar juice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">squirrel</span></em> again some people imagine they hear
something of the rustling and whirling of the little
animal. But we have only to trace the name back
to Greek, and there we find that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skiouros</span></em> is composed
of two distinct words, the one meaning shade, the
other tail; the animal being called shade-tail by the
Greeks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cat</span></em>, the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">katze</span></em>, is supposed
to be an imitation of the sound made by a cat spitting.
But if the spitting were expressed by the sibilant, that
sibilant does not exist in the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">catus</span></em>, nor in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cat</span></em>, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kitten</span></em>, nor in the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kater</span></em>.<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> The Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mârjâra</span></em>,
cat, might seem to imitate the purring of the cat;
but it is derived from the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mṛij</span></em>, to clean, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mârjâra</span></em>,
meaning the animal that always cleans itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many more instances might be given to show how
easily we are deceived by the constant connection of
certain sounds and certain meanings in the words of
our own language, and how readily we imagine that
there is something in the sound to tell us the meaning
of the words. <span class="tei tei-q">“The sound must seem an echo to the
sense.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of these Onomatopoieias vanish as soon as we
trace our own names back to Anglo-Saxon and Gothic,
or compare them with their cognates in Greek, Latin,
or Sanskrit. The number of names which are really
formed by an imitation of sound dwindle down to a
very small quotum if cross-examined by the comparative
philologist, and we are left in the end with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conviction that though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> language might have been
made out of the roaring, fizzing, hissing, gobbling,
twittering, cracking, banging, slamming, and rattling
sounds of nature, the tongues with which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> are acquainted
point to a different origin.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so we find many philosophers, and among them
Condillac, protesting against a theory which would
place man even below the animal. Why should man
be supposed, they say, to have taken a lesson from
birds and beasts? Does he not utter cries, and sobs,
and shouts himself, according as he is affected by fear,
pain, or joy? These cries or interjections were represented
as the natural and real beginnings of human
speech. Everything else was supposed to have been
elaborated after their model. This is what I call the
Interjectional, or Pooh-pooh, Theory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our answer to this theory is the same as to the
former. There are no doubt in every language interjections,
and some of them may become traditional,
and enter into the composition of words. But these
interjections are only the outskirts of real language.
Language begins where interjections end. There is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as much difference between a real word, such as <span class="tei tei-q">“to
laugh,”</span> and the interjection ha, ha! between <span class="tei tei-q">“I suffer,”</span>
and oh! as there is between the involuntary act
and noise of sneezing, and the verb <span class="tei tei-q">“to sneeze.”</span> We
sneeze, and cough, and scream, and laugh in the same
manner as animals, but if Epicurus tells us that we
speak in the same manner as dogs bark, moved by
nature,<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a> our own experience will tell us that this is
not the case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An excellent answer to the interjectional theory has
been given by Horne Tooke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The dominion of speech,”</span> he says,<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“is erected
upon the downfall of interjections. Without the artful
contrivances of language, mankind would have
had nothing but interjections with which to communicate,
orally, any of their feelings. The neighing of a
horse, the lowing of a cow, the barking of a dog, the
purring of a cat, sneezing, coughing, groaning, shrieking,
and every other involuntary convulsion with oral
sound, have almost as good a title to be called parts
of speech, as interjections have. Voluntary interjections
are only employed where the suddenness and
vehemence of some affection or passion returns men
to their natural state; and makes them for a moment
forget the use of speech; or when, from some circumstance,
the shortness of time will not permit them to
exercise it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As in the case of Onomatopoieia, it cannot be denied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that with interjections, too, some kind of language
might have been formed; but not a language like that
which we find in numerous varieties among all the races
of men. One short interjection may be more powerful,
more to the point, more eloquent than a long speech.
In fact, interjections, together with gestures, the movements
of the muscles of the mouth, and the eye, would
be quite sufficient for all purposes which language answers
with the majority of mankind. Lucian, in his
treatise on dancing, mentions a king whose dominions
bordered on the Euxine. He happened to be at Rome
in the reign of Nero, and, having seen a pantomime
perform, begged him of the emperor as a present, in
order that he might employ him as an interpreter
among the nations in his neighborhood with whom he
could hold no intercourse on account of the diversity
of language. A pantomime meant a person who could
mimic everything, and there is hardly anything which
cannot be thus expressed. We, having language at
our command, have neglected the art of speaking without
words; but in the south of Europe that art is
still preserved. If it be true that one look may speak
volumes, it is clear that we might save ourselves
much of the trouble entailed by the use of discursive
speech. Yet we must not forget that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hum!</span></em> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ugh!</span></em>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tut!</span></em> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pooh!</span></em> are as little to be called words as the expressive
gestures which usually accompany these exclamations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the attempts at deriving some of our words
etymologically from mere interjections, they are apt to
fail from the same kind of misconception which leads
us to imagine that there is something expressive in the
sounds of words. Thus it is said <span class="tei tei-q">“that the idea of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disgust takes its rise in the senses of smell and taste, in
the first instance probably in smell alone; that in defending
ourselves from a bad smell we are instinctively
impelled to screw up the nose, and to expire strongly
through the compressed and protruded lips, giving rise
to a sound represented by the interjections faugh! foh!
fie! From this interjection it is proposed to derive, not
only such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foul</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">filth</span></em>, but, by transferring it
from natural to moral aversion, the English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fiend</span></em>, the
German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Feind</span></em>.”</span> If this were true, we should suppose
that the expression of contempt was chiefly conveyed
by the aspirate f, by the strong emission of the breathing
with half-opened lips. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fiend</span></em> is a participle from
a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fian</span></em>, to hate; in Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fijan</span></em>; and as a Gothic
aspirate always corresponds to a tenuis in Sanskrit, the
same root in Sanskrit would at once lose its expressive
power. It exists in fact in Sanskrit as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pîy</span></em>, to hate, to
destroy; just as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">friend</span></em> is derived from a root which in
Sanskrit is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prî</span></em>, to delight.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is one more remark which I have to make
about the Interjectional and the Onomatopoëtic theories,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
namely this: If the constituent elements of human
speech were either mere cries, or the mimicking of the
cries of nature, it would be difficult to understand why
brutes should be without language. There is not only
the parrot, but the mocking-bird and others, which can
imitate most successfully both articulate and inarticulate
sounds; and there is hardly an animal without the faculty
of uttering interjections, such as huff, hiss, baa, &amp;c.
It is clear also that if what puts a perfect distinction
betwixt man and brutes is the having of general ideas,
language which arises from interjections and from the
imitation of the cries of animals could not claim to be
the outward sign of that distinctive faculty of man.
All words, in the beginning at least (and this is the
only point which interests us), would have been the
signs of individual impressions and individual perceptions,
and would only gradually have been adapted to
the expression of general ideas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The theory which is suggested to us by an analysis
of language carried out according to the principles of
comparative philology is the very opposite. We arrive
in the end at roots, and every one of these expresses a
general, not an individual, idea. Every name, if we
analyze it, contains a predicate by which the object to
which the name applies was known.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is an old controversy among philosophers,
whether language originated in general appellations, or
in proper names.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> It is the question of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primum
cognitum</span></em>, and its consideration will help us perhaps in
discovering the true nature of the root, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primum
appellatum</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some philosophers, among whom I may mention
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Locke, Condillac, Adam Smith, Dr. Brown, and with
some qualification Dugald Stewart, maintain that all
terms, as at first employed, are expressive of individual
objects. I quote from Adam Smith. <span class="tei tei-q">“The assignation,”</span>
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“of particular names to denote particular
objects, that is, the institution of nouns substantive,
would probably be one of the first steps towards the
formation of language. Two savages who had never
been taught to speak, but had been bred up remote
from the societies of men, would naturally begin to
form that language by which they would endeavor to
make their mutual wants intelligible to each other by
uttering certain sounds whenever they meant to denote
certain objects. Those objects only which were most
familiar to them, and which they had most frequent
occasion to mention, would have particular names assigned
to them. The particular cave whose covering
sheltered them from the weather, the particular tree
whose fruit relieved their hunger, the particular fountain
whose water allayed their thirst, would first be denominated
by the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cave</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tree</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fountain</span></em>, or by
whatever other appellations they might think proper,
in that primitive jargon, to mark them. Afterwards,
when the more enlarged experience of these savages
had led them to observe, and their necessary occasions
obliged them to make mention of, other caves, and other
trees, and other fountains, they would naturally bestow
upon each of those new objects the same name by which
they had been accustomed to express the similar object
they were first acquainted with. The new objects had
none of them any name of its own, but each of them
exactly resembled another object which had such an
appellation. It was impossible that those savages could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
behold the new objects without recollecting the old
ones; and the name of the old ones, to which the new
bore so close a resemblance. When they had occasion,
therefore, to mention or to point out to each other any
of the new objects, they would naturally utter the name
of the correspondent old one, of which the idea could
not fail, at that instant, to present itself to their memory
in the strongest and liveliest manner. And thus
those words, which were originally the proper names
of individuals, became the common name of a multitude.
A child that is just learning to speak calls every
person who comes to the house its papa or its mamma;
and thus bestows upon the whole species those names
which it had been taught to apply to two individuals.
I have known a clown who did not know the proper
name of the river which ran by his own door. It was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the river</span></em>, he said, and he never heard any other name
for it. His experience, it seems, had not led him to
observe any other river. The general word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">river</span></em> therefore
was, it is evident, in his acceptance of it, a proper
name signifying an individual object. If this person
had been carried to another river, would he not readily
have called it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a river</span></em>? Could we suppose any person
living on the banks of the Thames so ignorant as not
to know the general word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">river</span></em>, but to be acquainted
only with the particular word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thames</span></em>, if he were
brought to any other river, would he not readily call
it a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thames</span></em>? This, in reality, is no more than what
they who are well acquainted with the general word
are very apt to do. An Englishman, describing any
great river which he may have seen in some foreign
country, naturally says that it is another Thames....
It is this application of the name of an individual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to a great multitude of objects, whose resemblance
naturally recalls the idea of that individual, and
of the name which expresses it, that seems originally
to have given occasion to the formation of those classes
and assortments which, in the schools, are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This extract from Adam Smith will give a clear idea
of one view of the formation of thought and language.
I shall now read another extract, representing the diametrically
opposite view. It is taken from Leibniz,<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>
who maintains that general terms are necessary for the
essential constitution of languages. He likewise appeals
to children. <span class="tei tei-q">“Children,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“and those
who know but little of the language which they attempt
to speak, or little of the subject on which they would
employ it, make use of general terms, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plant</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></em>, instead of using proper names, of which they
are destitute. And it is certain that all proper or individual
names have been originally appellative or general.”</span>
And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus I would make bold to
affirm that almost all words have been originally general
terms, because it would happen very rarely that
man would invent a name, expressly and without a
reason, to denote this or that individual. We may,
therefore, assert that the names of individual things
were names of species, which were given <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></em>,
or otherwise, to some individual; as the name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
Head</span></em> to him of the whole town who had the largest,
or who was the man of the most consideration of the
great heads known.”</span>

It might seem presumptuous to attempt to arbitrate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
between such men as Leibniz and Adam Smith, particularly

this subject. But there are two ways of judging of
former philosophers. One is to put aside their opinions
as simply erroneous where they differ from our own.
This is the least satisfactory way of studying ancient
philosophy. Another way is to try to enter fully into
the opinions of those from whom we differ, to make
them, for a time at least, our own, till at last we discover
the point of view from which each philosopher
looked at the facts before him, and catch the light in
which he regarded them. We shall then find that
there is much less of downright error in the history
of philosophy than is commonly supposed; nay, we
shall find nothing so conducive to a right appreciation
of truth as a right appreciation of the error by which
it is surrounded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in the case before us, Adam Smith is no doubt
right, when he says that the first individual cave which
is called cave gave the name to all other caves. In the
same manner, the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">town</span></em>, though a mere enclosure,
gave the name to all other towns; the first imperial residence
on the Palatine hill gave the name to all palaces.
Slight differences between caves, towns, or palaces are
readily passed by, and the first name becomes more
and more general with every new individual to which
it is applied. So far Adam Smith is right, and the
history of almost every substantive might be cited in
support of his view. But Leibniz is equally right
when, in looking beyond the first emergence of such
names as cave or town or palace, he asks how such
names could have arisen. Let us take the Latin names
of cave. A cave in Latin is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antrum</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavea</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spelunca</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antrum</span></em> means really the same as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internum</span></em>.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Antar</span></em> in Sanskrit means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">between</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Antrum</span></em>,
therefore, meant originally what is within or inside the
earth or anything else. It is clear, therefore, that such
a name could not have been given to any individual
cave, unless the general idea of being within, or inwardness,
had been present in the mind. This general
idea once formed, and once expressed by the pronominal
root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antar</span></em>, the process of naming is clear and
intelligible. The place where the savage could live
safe from rain and from the sudden attacks of wild
beasts, a natural hollow in the rock, he would call his
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>, his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antrum</span></em>; and afterwards similar places,
whether dug in the earth or cut in a tree, would be
designated by the same name. The same general
idea, however, would likewise supply other names,
and thus we find that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entrails</span></em> were called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antra</span></em>
(neuter) in Sanskrit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enteron</span></em> in Greek, originally
things within.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us take another word for cave, which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">căvea</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">căverna</span></em>. Here again Adam Smith would be perfectly
right in maintaining that this name, when first given,
was applied to one particular cave, and was afterwards
extended to other caves. But Leibniz would be equally
right in maintaining that in order to call even the first
hollow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavea</span></em>, it was necessary that the general idea of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hollow</span></em> should have been formed in the mind, and should
have received its vocal expression <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cav</span></em>. Nay we may
go a step beyond, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavus</span></em>, or hollow, is a secondary,
not a primary, idea. Before a cave was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavea</span></em>, a
hollow thing, many things hollow had passed before the
eyes of men. Why then was a hollow thing, or a hole,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
called by the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cav</span></em>? Because what had been hollowed
out was intended at first as a place of safety and
protection, as a cover; and it was called therefore by
the root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ku</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sku</span></em>, which conveyed the idea of
to cover.<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>
Hence the general idea of covering existed in the mind
before it was applied to hiding-places in rocks or trees,
and it was not till an expression had thus been framed
for things hollow or safe in general, that caves in particular
could be designated by the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavea</span></em> or
hollows.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another form for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cavus</span></em> was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">koilos</span></em>, hollow. The
conception was originally the same; a hole was called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">koilon</span></em> because it served as a cover. But once so used
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">koilon</span></em> came to mean a cave, a vaulted cave, a vault,
and thus the heaven was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cœlum</span></em>, the modern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ciel</span></em>,
because it was looked upon as a vault or cover for the
earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the same with all nouns. They all express
originally one out of the many attributes of a thing,
and that attribute, whether it be a quality or an action,
is necessarily a general idea. The word thus formed
was in the first instance intended for one object only,
though of course it was almost immediately extended
to the whole class to which this object seemed to
belong. When a word such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rivus</span></em>, river, was first
formed, no doubt it was intended for a certain river, and that
river was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rivus</span></em>, from a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ru</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sru</span></em>,
to run, because of its running water. In many instances
a word meaning river or runner remained the
proper name of one river, without ever rising to the
dignity of an appellative. Thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhenus</span></em>, the Rhine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means river or runner, but it clung to one river, and
could not be used as an appellative for others. The
Ganges is the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gangâ</span></em>, literally the Go-go; a
word very well adapted for any majestic river, but
in Sanskrit restricted to the one sacred stream. The
Indus again is the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sindhu</span></em>, and means the irrigator,
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">syand</span></em>, to sprinkle. In this case, however,
the proper name was not checked in its growth, but
was used likewise as an appelative for any great stream.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have thus seen how the controversy about the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primum cognitum</span></em> assumes a new and perfectly clear
aspect. The first thing really known is the general.
It is through it that we know and name afterwards
individual objects of which any general idea can be
predicated, and it is only in the third stage that these
individual objects, thus known and named, become
again the representatives of whole classes, and their
names or proper names are raised into appellatives.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>

There is a petrified philosophy in language, and if
we examine the most ancient word for name we find it is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nâman</span></em> in Sanskrit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span></em> in Latin, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">namo</span></em> in Gothic.
This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nâman</span></em> stands for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gnâman</span></em>, which is preserved in
the Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-gnomen</span></em>. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></em> is dropped as in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natus</span></em>,
son, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gnatus</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nâman</span></em>, therefore, and name are

And how do we know things? We perceive things
by our senses, but our senses convey to us information
about single things only. But to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> is more than to
feel, than to perceive, more than to remember, more
than to compare. No doubt words are much abused.
We speak of a dog <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> his master, of an infant
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> his mother. In such expressions, to know
means to recognize. But to know a thing, means
more than to recognize it. We know a thing if we
are able to bring it, and any part of it, under more
general ideas. We then say, not that we have a perception,
but a conception, or that we have a general
idea of a thing. The facts of nature are perceived by
our senses; the thoughts of nature, to borrow an expression
of Oersted's, can be conceived by our reason
only.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> Now the first step towards this real knowledge,
a step which, however small in appearance, separates
man forever from all other animals, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naming of a
thing</span></em>, or the making a thing knowable. All naming
is classification, bringing the individual under the general;
and whatever we know, whether empirically or
scientifically, we know it only by means of our general
ideas. Other animals have sensation, perception,
memory, and, in a certain sense, intellect; but all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these, in the animal, are conversant with single objects
only. Man has sensation, perception, memory, intellect,
and reason, and it is his reason only that is conversant
with general ideas.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>

Through reason we not only stand a step above the
brute creation: we belong to a different world. We
look down on our merely animal experience, on our
sensations, perceptions, our memory, and our intellect,
as something belonging to us, but not as constituting
our most inward and eternal self. Our senses, our
memory, our intellect, are like the lenses of a telescope.
But there is an eye that looks through them at the
realities of the outer world, our own rational and self-conscious
soul; a power as distinct from our perceptive
faculties as the sun is from the earth which it fills
with light, and warmth, and life.

At the very point where man parts company with
the brute world, at the first flash of reason as the
manifestation of the light within us, there we see the
true genesis of language. Analyze any word you like,
and you will find that it expresses a general idea peculiar
to the individual to which the name belongs. What
is the meaning of moon?—the measurer. What is the
meaning of sun?—the begetter. What is the meaning
of earth?—the ploughed. The old name given to
animals, such as cows and sheep, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pasú</span></em>, the Latin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pecus</span></em>, which means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeders</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Animal</span></em> itself is a
later name, and derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anima</span></em>, soul. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anima</span></em> again
meant originally blowing or breathing, like spirit from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirare</span></em>, and was derived from a root, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an</span></em>, to blow,
which gives us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anila</span></em>, wind, in Sanskrit, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anemos</span></em>,
wind, in Greek. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ghost</span></em>, the German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Geist</span></em>, is based on
the same conception. It is connected with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gust</span></em>, with
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yeast</span></em>, and even with the hissing and boiling <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">geysers</span></em> of
Iceland. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Soul</span></em> is the Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saivala</span></em>, and this is clearly
related to another Gothic word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saivs</span></em>,<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> which means
the sea. The sea was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saivs</span></em> from a root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">si</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">siv</span></em>, the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seiō</span></em>, to shake; it meant the tossed-about
water, in contradistinction to stagnant or running
water. The soul being called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saivala</span></em>, we see
that it was originally conceived by the Teutonic nations
as a sea within, heaving up and down with every
breath, and reflecting heaven and earth on the mirror
of the deep.

The Sanskrit name for love is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">smara</span></em>; it is derived

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the serpent is called in Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sarpa</span></em>, it is
because it was conceived under the general idea of
creeping, an idea expressed by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">srip</span></em>. But the
serpent was also called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ahi</span></em> in Sanskrit, in Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">echis</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">echidna</span></em>, in Latin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anguis</span></em>. This name is derived
from quite a different root and idea. The root is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ah</span></em>
in Sanskrit, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anh</span></em>, which means to press together, to
choke, to throttle. Here the distinguishing mark
from which the serpent was named was his throttling,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ahi</span></em> meant serpent, as expressing the general idea
of throttler. It is a curious root this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anh</span></em>, and it still
lives in several modern words. In Latin it appears as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ango</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anxi</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anctum</span></em>, to strangle, in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angina</span></em>, quinsy,<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angor</span></em>, suffocation. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angor</span></em> meant not only quinsy
or compression of the neck; it assumed a moral import
and signifies anguish or anxiety. The two adjectives
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angustus</span></em>, narrow, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anxius</span></em>, uneasy, both come from
the same source. In Greek the root retained its natural
and material meaning; in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eggys</span></em>, near, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">echis</span></em>,
serpent, throttler. But in Sanskrit it was chosen with
great truth as the proper name of sin. Evil no doubt
presented itself under various aspects to the human
mind, and its names are many; but none so expressive
as those derived from our root, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anh</span></em>, to throttle. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Anhas</span></em>
in Sanskrit means sin, but it does so only because it
meant originally throttling,—the consciousness of sin
being like the grasp of the assassin on the throat of his
victim. All who have seen and contemplated the
statue of Laokoon and his sons, with the serpent
coiled round them from head to foot, may realize
what those ancients felt and saw when they called sin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anhas</span></em>, or the throttler. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anhas</span></em> is the same word
as the Greek <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agos</span></em>, sin. In Gothic the same root has
produced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agis</span></em>, in the sense of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fear</span></em>, and from the same
source we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">awe</span></em>, in awful, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> fearful, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ug</span></em>, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ugly</span></em>. The English <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anguish</span></em> is
from the French <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angoisse</span></em>,
the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">angoscia</span></em>, a corruption of the Latin

mortals unless they had believed in other beings as
immortal.

many names for all things in ancient languages. Any
feature that struck the observing mind as peculiarly
characteristic could be made to furnish a new name.
The sun might be called the bright, the warm, the golden,
the preserver, the destroyer, the wolf, the lion, the
heavenly eye, the father of light and life. Hence that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
superabundance of synonymes in ancient dialects, and
hence that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">struggle for life</span></em> carried on among these words,
which led to the destruction of the less strong, the less
happy, the less fertile words, and ended in the triumph
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, as the recognized and proper name for every
object in every language. On a very small scale this
process of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural selection</span></em>, or, as it would better be
called, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elimination</span></em>, may still be watched even in modern
languages, that is to say, even in languages so old and
full of years as English and French. What it was at the
first burst of dialects we can only gather from such isolated
cases as when Vón Hammer counts 5744 words
relating to the camel.<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>

The fact that every word is originally a predicate,
that names, though signs of individual conceptions, are
all, without exception, derived from general ideas, is one
of the most important discoveries in the science of language.
It was known before that language is the distinguishing
characteristic of man; it was known also
that the having of general ideas is that which puts a
perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes; but that
these two were only different expressions of the same
fact was not known till the theory of roots had been
established as preferable to the theories both of Onomatopoieia
and of Interjections. But, though our
modern philosophy did not know it, the ancient poets
and framers of language must have known it. For in
Greek language is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logos</span></em>, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logos</span></em> means also reason,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alogon</span></em> was chosen as the name, and the most
proper name, for brute. No animal thinks, and no
animal speaks, except man. Language and thought
are inseparable. Words without thought are dead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sounds; thoughts without words are nothing. To
think is to speak low; to speak is to think aloud.
The word is the thought incarnate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now I am afraid I have but a few minutes left to
explain the last question of all in our science, namely—How
can sound express thought? How did roots
become the signs of general ideas? How was the abstract
idea of measuring expressed by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mâ</span></em>, the idea of
thinking by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>? How did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gâ</span></em> come to mean going,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sthâ</span></em> standing, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sad</span></em> sitting, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dâ</span></em> giving,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mar</span></em> dying, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">char</span></em>
walking, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kar</span></em> doing?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall try to answer as briefly as possible. The 400
or 500 roots which remain as the constituent elements
in different families of language are not interjections,
nor are they imitations. They are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phonetic types</span></em> produced
by a power inherent in human nature. They
exist, as Plato would say, by nature; though with
Plato we should add that, when we say by nature, we
mean by the hand of God.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> There is a law which
runs through nearly the whole of nature, that everything
which is struck rings. Each substance has its
peculiar ring. We can tell the more or less perfect
structure of metals by their vibrations, by the answer
which they give. Gold rings differently from tin, wood
rings differently from stone; and different sounds are
produced according to the nature of each percussion.
It was the same with man, the most highly organized
of nature's works.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> Man, in his primitive and perfect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
state, was not only endowed, like the brute, with the
power of expressing his sensations by interjections, and
his perceptions by onomatopoieia. He possessed likewise
the faculty of giving more articulate expression to
the rational conceptions of his mind. That faculty
was not of his own making. It was an instinct, an
instinct of the mind as irresistible as any other instinct.
So far as language is the production of that instinct, it
belongs to the realm of nature. Man loses his instincts
as he ceases to want them. His senses become fainter
when, as in the case of scent, they become useless.
Thus the creative faculty which gave to each conception,
as it thrilled for the first time through the brain,
a phonetic expression, became extinct when its object
was fulfilled. The number of these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phonetic types</span></em> must
have been almost infinite in the beginning, and it was
only through the same process of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural elimination</span></em>
which we observed in the early history of words, that
clusters of roots, more or less synonymous, were gradually
reduced to one definite type. Instead of deriving
language from nine roots, like Dr. Murray,<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> or from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> root, a feat actually accomplished by a Dr.
Schmidt,<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>
we must suppose that the first settlement of the radical
elements of language was preceded by a period of unrestrained
growth,—the spring of speech—to be followed
by many an autumn.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the process of elimination, or natural selection,
the historical element enters into the science of
language. However primitive the Chinese may be
as compared with terminational and inflectional languages,
its roots or words have clearly passed through
a long process of mutual attrition. There are many
things of a merely traditional character even in Chinese.
The rule that in a simple sentence the first word is the
subject, the second the verb, the third the object, is a
traditional rule. It is by tradition only that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngŏ ģin</span></em>,
in Chinese, means a bad man, whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin ngŏ</span></em> signifies
man is bad. The Chinese themselves distinguish between
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">empty</span></em> roots,<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> the former being predicative,
the latter corresponding to our particles which
modify the meaning of full roots and determine their
relation to each other. It is only by tradition that
roots become empty. All roots were originally full
whether predicative or demonstrative, and the fact that
empty roots in Chinese cannot always be traced back
to their full prototypes shows that even the most ancient
Chinese had passed through successive periods of
growth. Chinese commentators admit that all empty
words were originally full words, just as Sanskrit grammarians
maintain that all that is found in grammar was
originally substantial. But we must be satisfied with
but partial proofs of this general principle, and must be
prepared to find as many fanciful derivations in Chinese
as in Sanskrit. The fact, again, that all roots in Chinese
are no longer capable of being employed at pleasure,
either as substantives, or verbs, or adjectives, is
another proof that, even in this most primitive stage,
language points back to a previous growth. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fu</span></em> is father,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mu</span></em> is mother; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fu mu</span></em> parents; but neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fu</span></em> nor
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mu</span></em> is used as a root in its original predicative sense.
The amplest proof, however, of the various stages
through which even so simple a language as Chinese
must have passed is to be found in the comparatively
small number of roots, and in the definite meanings
attached to each; a result which could only have been
obtained by that constant struggle which has been so
well described in natural history as the struggle for life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although this sifting of roots, and still more the
subsequent combination of roots, cannot be ascribed to
the mere working of nature or natural instincts, it is
still less, as we saw in a former Lecture, the effect of
deliberate or premeditated art, in the sense in which,
for instance, a picture of Raphael or a symphony of
Beethoven is. Given a root to express flying, or bird,
and another to express heap, then the joining together
of the two to express many birds, or birds in the plural,
is the natural effect of the synthetic power of the human
mind, or, to use more homely language, of the
power of putting two and two together. Some philosophers
maintain indeed that this explains nothing,
and that the real mystery to be solved is how the mind
can form a synthesis, or conceive many things as one.
Into those depths we cannot follow. Other philosophers
imagine that the combination of roots to form
agglutinative and inflectional language is, like the first
formation of roots, the result of a natural instinct.
Thus Professor Heyse<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> maintained that <span class="tei tei-q">“the various
forms of development in language must be explained
by the philosophers as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> evolutions, founded in
the very essence of human speech.”</span> This is not the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
case. We can watch the growth of language, and we
can understand and explain all that is the result of that
growth. But we cannot undertake to prove that all
that is in language is so by necessity, and could not
have been otherwise. When we have, as in Chinese,
two such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kiai</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tu</span></em>, both expressing a heap,
an assembly, a quantity, then we may perfectly understand
why either the one or the other should have been
used to form the plural. But if one of the two becomes
fixed and traditional, while the other becomes obsolete,
then we can register the fact as historical, but no
philosophy on earth will explain its absolute necessity.
We can perfectly understand how, with two such roots
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kûŏ</span></em>, empire, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ćung</span></em>, middle, the Chinese should
have formed what we call a locative, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kŭŏ ćung</span></em>, in the
empire. But to say that this was the only way to express
this conception is an assertion contradicted both
by fact and reason. We saw the various ways in which
the future can be formed. They are all equally intelligible
and equally possible, but not one of them is
inevitable. In Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳaó</span></em> means to will, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngò</span></em> is I;
hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngò ỳaó</span></em>, I will. The same root <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ỳaó</span></em>, added to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ḱiú</span></em>, to go, gives us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngò ỳaó ḱiú</span></em>, I will go, the first
germ of our futures. To say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ngò ỳaó ḱiú</span></em> was the
necessary form of the future in Chinese would introduce
a fatalism into language which rests on no authority
whatever. The building up of language is not like
the building of the cells in a beehive, nor is it like the
building of St. Peter's by Michael Angelo. It is the
result of innumerable agencies, working each according
to certain laws, and leaving in the end the result of
their combined efforts freed from all that proved superfluous
or useless. From the first combination of two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such words as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin</span></em>, man, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kiai</span></em>, many, to form the plural
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ģin kiai</span></em>, to the perfect grammar of Sanskrit and Greek,
everything is intelligible as the result of the two principles
of growth which we considered in our second
Lecture. What is antecedent to the production of
roots is the work of nature; what follows after is the
work of man, not in his individual and free, but in his
collective and moderating, capacity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not say that every form in Greek or Sanskrit
has as yet been analyzed and explained. There are
formations in Greek and Latin and English which
have hitherto baffled all tests; and there are certain
contrivances, such as the augment in Greek, the change
of vowels in Hebrew, the Umlaut and Ablaut in the
Teutonic dialects, where we might feel inclined to
suppose that language admitted distinctions purely
musical or phonetic, corresponding to very palpable
and material distinctions of thought. Such a supposition,
however, is not founded on any safe induction.
It may seem inexplicable to us why <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bruder</span></em> in
German should form its plural as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brüder</span></em>; or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brother</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brethren</span></em>. But what is inexplicable and apparently
artificial in our modern languages becomes intelligible
in their more ancient phases. The change of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">u</span></em> into
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ü</span></em>, as in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bruder</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brüder</span></em>, was not intentional; least
of all was it introduced to expressed plurality. The
change is phonetic, and due to the influence of an
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j</span></em>,<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> which existed originally in the last syllable
and which reacted regularly on the vowel of the
preceding syllable; nay, which leaves its effect behind,
even after it has itself disappeared. By a
false analogy such a change, perfectly justifiable in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain class of words, may be applied to other words
where no such change was called for; and it may
then appear as if an arbitrary change of vowels was
intended to convey a grammatical change. But even
into these recesses the comparative philologist can follow
language, thus discovering a reason even for what
in reality was irrational and wrong. It seems difficult
to believe that the augment in Greek should originally
have had an independent substantial existence, yet all
analogy is in favor of such a view. Suppose English
had never been written down before Wycliffe's time,
we should then find that in some instances the perfect
was formed by the mere addition of a short <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>. Wycliffe
spoke and wrote:<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I knowlech to a felid and seid
þus</span></em>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> I acknowledge to have felt and said thus.
In a similar way we read: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it should a fallen</span></em>; instead
of <span class="tei tei-q">“it should have fallen;”</span> and in some parts of
England common people still say very much the same:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I should a done it</span></em>. Now in some old English books
this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> actually coalesces with the verb, at least they
are printed together; so that a grammar founded on
them would give us <span class="tei tei-q">“to fall”</span> as the infinitive of the
present, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to afallen</span></em> as the infinitive of the past. I do
not wish for a moment to be understood as if there was
any connection between this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>, a contraction of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> in
English, and the Greek augment which is placed before
past tenses. All I mean is, that, if the origin of the
augment has not yet been satisfactorily explained, we
are not therefore to despair, or to admit an arbitrary
addition of a consonant or vowel, used as it were algebraically
or by mutual agreement, to distinguish a
past from a present tense.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If inductive reasoning is worth anything, we are
justified in believing that what has been proved to
be true on so large a scale, and in cases where it was
least expected, is true with regard to language in general.
We require no supernatural interference, nor any
conclave of ancient sages, to explain the realities of
human speech. All that is formal in language is the
result of rational combination; all that is material,
the result of a mental instinct. The first natural and
instinctive utterances, if sifted differently by different
clans, would fully account both for the first origin and
for the first divergence of human speech. We can understand
not only the origin of language, but likewise
the necessary breaking up of one language into many;
and we perceive that no amount of variety in the material
or the formal elements of speech is incompatible
with the admission of one common source.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Science of Language thus leads us up to that
highest summit from whence we see into the very dawn
of man's life on earth; and where the words which we
have heard so often from the days of our childhood—<span class="tei tei-q">“And
the whole earth was of one language and of one
speech”</span>—assume a meaning more natural, more intelligible,
more convincing, than they ever had before.

of language as one of the palaitiological
sciences; but he makes a distinction between palaitiological sciences
treating of material things, for instance, geology, and others respecting
the products which result from man's imaginative and social endowments,
for instance, comparative philology. He excludes the latter from the circle
of the physical sciences, properly so called, but he adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“We began
our inquiry with the trust that any sound views which we should be able
to obtain respecting the nature of truth in the physical sciences, and the
mode of discovering it, must also tend to throw light upon the nature and
prospects of knowledge of all other kinds;—must be useful to us in moral,
political, and philological researches. We stated this as a confident anticipation;
and the evidence of the justice of our belief already begins to appear.
We have seen that biology leads us to psychology, if we choose to
follow the path; and thus the passage from the material to the immaterial
has already unfolded itself at one point; and we now perceive that there
are several large provinces of speculation which concern subjects belonging
to man's immaterial nature, and which are governed by the same laws
as sciences altogether physical. It is not our business to dwell on the
prospects which our philosophy thus opens to our contemplation; but we
may allow ourselves, in this last stage of our pilgrimage among the
foundations of the physical sciences, to be cheered and animated by the
ray that thus beams upon us, however dimly, from a higher and brighter
region.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Indications of the Creator</span></span>, p. 146.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_14" name="note_14" href="#noteref_14">14.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Gen. ii. 19.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_15" name="note_15" href="#noteref_15">15.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">St.
Basil was accused by Eunomius of denying Divine Providence, because
he would not admit that God had created the names of all things,

in man. St. Gregory, bishop of Nyssa in Cappadocia (331-396),
defended St. Basil. <span class="tei tei-q">“Though God has given to human nature its faculties,”</span>
he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“it does not follow that therefore He produces all the actions
which we perform. He has given us the faculty of building a house
and doing any other work; but we surely are the builders, and not He. In
the same manner our faculty of speaking is the work of Him who has so
framed our nature; but the invention of words for naming each object is
the work of our mind.”</span> See Ladevi-Roche, De l'Origine du Langage:

influence was exercised by Indian on Greek philosophers. Pyrrhon, if we may believe
Alexander Polyhistor, seems indeed to have accompanied Alexander on his
expedition to India, and one feels tempted to connect the scepticism of
Pyrrhon with the system of Buddhist philosophy then current in India.
But the ignorance of the language on both sides must have been an insurmountable
barrier between the Greek and the Indian thinkers. (Fragmenta

the Tibetan languages the rule is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Adjectives are formed from substantives
by the addition of the genitive sign,”</span> which might be inverted
into, <span class="tei tei-q">“The genitive is formed from the nominative by the addition of the
adjective sign.”</span> For instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shing</span></em>,
wood; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shing gi</span></em>, of wood, or wooden:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ser</span></em>, gold; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ser-gyi</span></em>, of gold,
or golden: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mi</span></em>, man; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mi-yi</span></em>, of man, or human.
The same in Garo, where the sign of the genitive
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ni</span></em>, we have; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mánde-ní
jak</span></em>, the hand of man, or the human hand; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ambal-ní ketháli</span></em>, a wooden
knife, or a knife of wood. In Hindustání the genitive is so clearly an adjective,
that it actually takes the marks of gender according to the words to which
it refers. But how is it in Sanskrit and Greek? In Sanskrit we may form
adjectives by the addition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tya</span></em>.
(Turanian Languages, p. 41, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>; Essay
on Bengálí, p. 333.) For instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dakshiņâ</span></em>,
south; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dakshiņâ-tya</span></em>, southern.
This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tya</span></em> is clearly a demonstrative pronoun,
the same as the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">syas</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">syâ</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tyad</span></em>, this or that.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tya</span></em> is a pronominal base, and therefore such adjectives
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dakshiņâ-tya</span></em>, southern, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âp-tya</span></em>, aquatic, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âp</span></em>, water, must have
been conceived originally as <span class="tei tei-q">“water-there,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“south-there.”</span> Followed
by the terminations of the nominative singular, which was again an original
pronoun, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âptyas</span></em> would mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âp-tya-s</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, water-there-he. Now, it
makes little difference whether I say an aquatic bird or a bird of the water.
In Sanskrit the genitive of water would be, if we
take <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">udaka</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">udaka-sya</span></em>.
This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sya</span></em> is the same pronominal base as
the adjective termination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tya</span></em>, only
that the former takes no sign for the gender, like the adjective. The genitive
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">udakasya</span></em> is therefore the same as an adjective without gender. Now
let us look to Greek. We there form adjectives by σιος, which is the same
as the Sanskrit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tya</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sya</span></em>. For instance, from
δῆμος, people, the Greeks
formed δημόσιος, belonging to the people. Here ος, α, ον, mark the gender.
Leave the gender out, and you get δημοσιο. Now, there is a rule in Greek
that an ς between two vowels, in grammatical terminations, is elided. Thus
the genitive of γένος is not γένεσος, but γένεος, or γένους;
hence δημόσιο
would necessarily become δήμοιο. And what is δήμοιο but the regular
Homeric genitive of δῆμος, which in later Greek was replaced by δήμου?
Thus we see that the same principles which governed the formation of adjectives
and genitives in Tibetan, in Garo, and Hindustání, were at work
in the primitive stages of Sanskrit and Greek; and we perceive how accurately
the real power of the genitive was determined by the ancient Greek
grammarians, who called it the general or predicative case, whereas the
Romans spoiled the term by wrongly translating it into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genitivus</span></em>.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_100" name="note_100" href="#noteref_100">100.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">See

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Chinese do not decline their substantives, but they indicate the cases
distinctly—
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. By means of particles.<br />
B. By means of position.<br />
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The nominative or the subject of a sentence is always placed at the
beginning.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The genitive may be marked—
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) By the particle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tchi</span></em>
placed between the two nouns, of which the first
is in the genitive, the second in the nominative. Example, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jin tchi kiun</span></em>
(hominum princeps, literally, man, sign of the genitive, prince.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) By position, placing the word which is in the genitive first,
and the word which is in the nominative second. Ex. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">koue</span></em> (kingdom)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jin</span></em> (man) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a man of the kingdom.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The dative may be expressed—
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) By the preposition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu</span></em>, to. Ex.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sse</span></em> (to give) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yen</span></em> (money) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu</span></em> (to) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jin</span></em>
(man).
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) By position, placing first the verb, then the word which
stands in the dative, lastly, the word which stands in the accusative. Ex.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu</span></em> (to give) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jin</span></em> (to a man) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pe</span></em> (white)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yu</span></em> (jade), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hoang</span></em> (yellow) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kin</span></em> (metal),
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, gold.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The accusative is either left without any mark, for instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pao</span></em> (to
protect) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">min</span></em> (the people), or it is preceded by certain words which had
originally a more tangible meaning, but gradually dwindled away into
mere signs of the accusative. [These were first discovered and correctly
explained by M. Stanislas Julien in his Vindiciæ Philologicæ in Linguam
Sinicam, Paris, 1830.] The particles most frequently used for this purpose
by modern writers are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pa</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tsiang</span></em>, to grasp, to take. Ex.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pa</span></em> (taking) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tchoung-jin</span></em> (crowd of men) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">t'eou</span></em>
(secretly) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">k'an</span></em> (he looked) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, he looked
secretly at the crowd of men (hominum turbam furtim aspiciebat). In the

the Æolians and of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus and the islands. Nevertheless he
argues (i. 57), from the dialect spoken in his time by the Pelasgi of the
towns of Kreston, Plakia, and Skylake, that the old Pelasgi spoke a barbarous
tongue (βάρβαρον τὴν γλῶσσαν ἱέντες). He has, therefore, to admit
that the Attic race, being originally Pelasgic, unlearnt its language (τὸ
Ἀττικὸν ἔθνος ἐὸν Πελασγικόν, ἅμα τῇ μεταβόλη τῇ ἐς Ἕλληνας, καὶ τὴν
γλῶσσαν μετέμαθε). See Diefenbach, Origines Europææ, p. 59. Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (i. 17) avoids this difficulty by declaring the Pelasgi
to have been from the beginning a Hellenic race. This however, is
merely his own theory. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Karians</span></em> are called βαρβαρόφωνοι by Homer
(II. v. 867); but Strabo (xiv. 662) takes particular care to show that they
are not therefore to be considered as βάρβαροι. He distinguishes between
βαρβαροφωνεῖν, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, κακῶς ἑλληνίζειν, and Καριστὶ λαλαεῖν,
καρίζειν καὶ βαρβαρίζειν. But the same Strabo says that the Karians were formerly
called Λέλεγεs (xii. p. 572); and these, together with Pelasgians and Kaukones,
are reckoned by him (vii. p. 321) as the earlier <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">barbarous</span></em> inhabitants
of Hellas. Again he (vii. p. 321), as well as Aristotle and Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (i. 17), considers the Locrians as descendants of the
Leleges, though they would hardly call the Locrians barbarians.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Macedonians</span></em> are mentioned by Strabo (x. p. 460) together with
<span class="tei tei-q">“the other Hellenes.”</span> Demosthenes speaks of Alexander as a barbarian;
Isokrates as a Heraclide. To judge from a few extant words, Macedonian
might have been a Greek dialect. (Diefenbach, Orig. Europ. p. 62.) Justine
(vii. 1) says of the Macedonians, <span class="tei tei-q">“Populus Pelasgi, regio Pæonia dicebatur.”</span>
There was a tradition that the country occupied by the Macedonians
belonged formerly to Thracians or Pierians (Thuc. ii. 99; Strabo, vii.
p. 321); part of it to Thessalians (ibid.).
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thracians</span></em> are called by Herodotus (v. 3) the greatest people after
the Indians. They are distinguished by Strabo from Illyrians (Diefenbach,
p. 65), from Celts (ibid.), and from Scythians (Thuc. ii. 96). What
we know of their language rests on a statement of Strabo (vii. 303, 305),
that the Thracians spoke the same language as the Getæ, and the Getæ the
same as the Dacians. We possess fragments of Dacian speech in the botanical
names collected by Dioskorides, and these, as interpreted by Grimm,
are clearly Aryan, though not Greek. The Dacians are called barbarians
by Strabo, together with Illyrians and Epirotes. (Strabo, vii. p. 321.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Illyrians</span></em> were barbarians in the eyes of the Greeks. They are now
considered as an independent branch of the Aryan family. Herodotus
refers the Veneti to the Illyrians (i. 196); and the Veneti, according
to Polybius (ii. 17), who knew them, spoke a language different from
that of the Celts. He adds that they were an old race, and in their manner
and dress like the Celts. Hence many writers have mistaken them
for Celts, neglecting the criterion of language, on which Polybius lays
such proper stress. The Illyrians were a widely extended race; the Pannonians,
the Dalmatians, and the Dardanians (from whom the Dardanelles
were called), are all spoken of as Illyrians. (Diefenbach, Origines Europææ,
pp. 74, 75.) It is lost labor to try to extract anything positive from
the statements of the Greeks and Romans on the race and the language of
their barbarian neighbors.

antiquarian recognizes at once the workings of intelligence
in the remains of an ancient civilization. He may fail to ascertain their
age correctly, he may remain doubtful as to the order in which they were
successively constructed, but the character of the whole tells him they are
works of art, and that men like himself originated these relics of by-gone
ages. So shall the intelligent naturalist read at once in the pictures which
nature presents to him, the works of a higher Intelligence; he shall recognize
in the minute perforated cells of the coniferæ, which differ so wonderfully
from those of other plants, the hieroglyphics of a peculiar age; in
their needle-like leaves, the escutcheon of a peculiar dynasty; in their repeated
appearance under most diversified circumstances, a thoughtful and
thought-eliciting adaptation. He beholds, indeed, the works of a being
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinking</span></em> like himself, but he feels, at the same time, that he stands as
much below the Supreme Intelligence, in wisdom, power, and goodness, as the works
of art are inferior to the wonders of nature. Let naturalists look at the
world under such impressions, and evidence will pour in upon us that all
creatures are expressions of the thoughts of Him whom we know, love,
and adore unseen.”</span></p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_109" name="note_109" href="#noteref_109">109.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Rom. i. 20.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_110" name="note_110" href="#noteref_110">110.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hervas (Catalogo, i. 37)

Tiguri, 1548, 4to. It contains the Lord's Prayer in fourteen languages.
Bibliander derives Welsh and Cornish from Greek, Greek having been carried
there from Marseilles, through France. He states that Armenian
differs little from Chaldee, and cites Postel, who derived the Turks from the
Armenians, because Turkish was spoken in Armenia. He treats the Persians
as descendants of Shem, and connects their language with Syriac and
Hebrew. Servian and Georgian are, according to him, dialects of Greek.

among the seventy-two languages which sprang from the Tower of
Babel, it must be derived from Greek. He quotes Cæsar (de Bello Gallico,

modern French language!
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The works of Henri Estienne (1528-1598) stand on a much sounder basis.
He has been unjustly accused of having derived French from Greek. See
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Traicté de la Conformité du Langage français avec le grec;”</span> about
1566. It contains chiefly syntactical and grammatical remarks, and its object
is to show that modes of expression in Greek, which sound anomalous

in French.

that we ought to begin with studying the modern languages which are
within our reach, in order to compare them with one another, to discover
their differences and affinities, and then to proceed to those which have
preceded them in former ages, in order to show their filiation and their
origin, and then to ascend step by step to the most ancient tongues, the
analysis of which must lead us to the only trustworthy conclusions.”</span></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_119" name="note_119" href="#noteref_119">119.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Nicolaes Witsen, Burgomaster of Amsterdam, travelled in Russia,

when we find that two languages practise these great arts of language,—derivation,

I think, with great certainty, that the one language is the original of the

has been common among grammarians to regard those terminational
changes as evolved by some unknown process from the body of the
noun, as the branches of a tree spring from the stem—or as elements, unmeaning
in themselves, but employed arbitrarily or conventionally to modify
the meanings of words. This latter view is countenanced by Schlegel.
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Languages with inflexions,’</span> says Schlegel, <span class="tei tei-q">‘are organic languages, because
they include a living principle of development and increase, and alone possess,
if I may so express myself, a fruitful and abundant vegetation. The
wonderful mechanism of these languages consists in forming an immense
variety of words, and in marking the connection of ideas expressed by
these words by the help of an inconsiderable number of syllables, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which,
viewed separately, have no signification</span></em>, but which determine with precision
the sense of the words to which they are attached. By modifying radical
letters and by adding derivative syllables to the roots, derivative words of
various sorts are formed, and derivatives from those derivatives. Words
are compounded from several roots to express complex ideas. Finally,
substantives, adjectives, and pronouns are declined, with gender, number,
and case; verbs are conjugated throughout voices, moods, tenses, numbers,
and persons, by employing, in like manner, terminations and sometimes
augments, which by themselves signify nothing. This method is attended
with the advantage of enunciating in a single word the principal idea, frequently
greatly modified, and extremely complex already, with its whole array
of accessory ideas and mutable relations.’</span> ”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Transactions

I state these views on the authority of M. Pictet, I think it
right to add the following note which an eminent Irish scholar has had the
kindness to send me:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The ordinary name of Ireland, in the oldest Irish
MSS., is (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>)<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ériu</span></em>, gen. (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>)<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">érenn</span></em>,
dat. (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>)<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">érinn</span></em>. The initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>, is often omitted.
Before etymologizing on the word, we must try to fix its Old Celtic form.
Of the ancient names of Ireland which are found in Greek and Latin
writers, the only one which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hériu</span></em> can
formally represent is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hiberio</span></em>. The
abl. sing. of this form—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hiberione</span></em>—is
found in the Book of Armagh, a
Latin MS. of the early part of the ninth century. From the same MS. we
also learn that a name of the Irish people was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyberionaces</span></em>, which is
obviously a derivative from the stem of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hiberio</span></em>. Now if we remember that
the Old Irish scribes often prefixed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>
to words beginning with a vowel (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h-abunde</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h-arundo</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h-erimus</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h-ostium</span></em>), and that they also often wrote <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></em> for
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></em> consonant (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bobes</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fribulas</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corbus</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fabonius</span></em>); if, moreover, we
observe that the Welsh and Breton names for Ireland—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ywerddon</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iverdon</span></em>—point to an Old Celtic name beginning with
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iver</span></em>—, we shall have little difficulty in giving
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hiberio</span></em> a correctly latinized form, viz. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iverio</span></em>. This
in Old Celtic would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iveriu</span></em>, gen. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iverionos</span></em>. So the
Old Celtic form of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fronto</span></em> was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Frontû</span></em>, as we see from the
Gaulish inscription at Vieux Poitiers. As <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></em> when flanked by vowels is
always lost in Irish, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iveriû</span></em> would
become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ieriu</span></em>, and then, the first two vowels
running together, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ériu</span></em>. As
regards the double <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></em> in the oblique cases of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ériu</span></em>, the genitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">érenn</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>)
is to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iverionos</span></em> as the Old Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anmann</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">‘names’</span> is to the Skr. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nâmâni</span></em>, Lat.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nomina</span></em>. The doubling of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></em> may perhaps be due to the Old
Celtic accent. What then is the etymology of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iveriû</span></em>? I venture to think that
it may (like the Lat. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Aver-nus</span></em>, Gr. Ἄφορ-νος) be connected with the Skr.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">avara</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘posterior,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘western.’</span>
So the Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">des</span></em>, Welsh <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deheu</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘right,’</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">‘south,’</span> is the Skr. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dakshina</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘dexter,’</span> and the
Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">áir</span></em> (in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an-áir</span></em>), if it
stand for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">páir</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘east,’</span> is the Skr. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pûrva</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘anterior.’</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“M. Pictet regards Ptolemy's Ἰουερνια (Ivernia) as coming nearest to the
Old Celtic form of the name in question. He further sees in the first syllable
what he calls the Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibh</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘land,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘tribe of people,’</span>
and he thinks that this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibh</span></em> may be
connected not only with the Vedic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibha</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘family,’</span> but with the
Old High German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eiba</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘a district.’</span> But, first, according to the Irish
phonetic laws, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibha</span></em> would have appeared as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eb</span></em> in Old,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eabh</span></em> in Modern-Irish. Secondly, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eiba</span></em> is
a diphthong = Gothic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ái</span></em>, Irish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ói</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">óe</span></em>, Skr.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ê</span></em>. Consequently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibh</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibha</span></em> cannot be identified
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eiba</span></em>. Thirdly, there is no
such word as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibh</span></em> in the nom. sing., although it is to be found in O'Reilly's
dictionary, along with his explanation of the intensive prefix <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">er</span></em>—, as
<span class="tei tei-q">‘noble,’</span> and many other blunders and forgeries. The form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ibh</span></em> is, no
doubt, producible, but it is a very modern dative plural of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">úa</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘a
descendant.’</span> Irish districts were often called by the names of the occupying clans.
These clans were often called <span class="tei tei-q">‘descendants (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">huí</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hí</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">í</span></em>) of such an one.’</span>
Hence the blunder of the Irish lexicographer.”</span>—W. S.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_249" name="note_249" href="#noteref_249">249.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">See Rawlinson's Glossary,

Stanislas Julien remarks that the numerous compounds which occur
in Chinese prove the wide-spread influence of the principle of agglutination
in that language. The fact is, that in Chinese every sound has numerous
meanings; and in order to avoid ambiguity, one word is frequently followed
by another which agrees with it in that particular meaning which is
intended by the speaker. Thus:—
